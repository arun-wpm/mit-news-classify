Tom C. Griscom, who served as press secretary to Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate Republican leader, was sounded out for the Bush job but did not express any interest.Mr. Bush is in need of a new press spokesman fairly quickly. He is to give a series of Lincoln Day dinner speeches in a few weeks in such politically potent states as New Hampshire and Michigan, and favorable press attention is something the Vice President needs as he approaches his Presidential candidacy.The Vice President did fill one vacancy, created when his speech writer, Clark Judge, was shifted to President Reagan's staff. Mr. Judge was replaced by Mark McIntyre, who formerly served as press secretary to Representative Bob Livingston, Republican of Louisiana.Mr. Fitzwater takes over his new role next week, succeeding Larry Speakes, who managed Mr. Reagan's press affairs for almost six years. In leaving, to take a job with Merrill Lynch, Mr. Speakes is showing that he can manage his own press affairs as well. Today's briefing will be his last, and Mr. Speakes has counted them all up and has determined that today's will also be his 2,000th, which probably is a record, although no one is known to have kept track of that statistic.WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING",9360836,9360846

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,SALINGER BIOGRAPHY IS BLOCKED,"LEAD: A biography of J. D. Salinger was blocked yesterday by a Federal appeals court in Manhattan that said the book unfairly used Mr. Salinger's unpublished letters.A biography of J. D. Salinger was blocked yesterday by a Federal appeals court in Manhattan that said the book unfairly used Mr. Salinger's unpublished letters.Reversing a lower court decision, the appeals court ruled in favor of Mr. Salinger, who filed suit to prohibit the biography from using all material from the letters, which he wrote many years ago.''We're delighted,'' said R. Andrew Boose, the attorney for Mr. Salinger. ''We've told him of the decision, and he is also delighted.'' Publication Delayed Last YearThe disputed biography, ''J. D. Salinger: A Writing Life'' by Ian Hamilton, was to be published late last year by Random House, but it was held up by the unusual court case.A Random House spokesman said after the appeals court ruling yesterday, ''We are not going to be able to comment until we've had a chance to study the opinion.'' The only further legal appeal for the publishing house is in the Supreme Court of the United States.In its 24-page decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the case focused on ''whether the biographer of a renowned author has made 'fair use' of his subject's unpublished letters.'' The 'Fair Use' StandardAccording to legal scholars, the ''fair use'' standard is vague and open to wide interpretation.Legal opinion on the appeal court's ruling was varied. Charles Rembar, a noted constitutional lawyer, had not seen the opinion. But from the language the court used in announcing the decision, he said, ''then the conclusion is inescapable - the judgment had to follow, as the night the day.''But Floyd Abrams, another noted constitutional lawyer, expressed reservations. ''It seems to me a deeply troubling limitation on the ability of a publisher to print a significant book,'' he said, ''and of the public to learn about one of the most fascinating and important writers of our time.''Mr. Salinger wrote the letters to his friend and editor, Whit Burnett, and to several other people, including Ernest Hemingway.''The biography,'' the appeals court said, ''copies virtually all of the most interesting passages of the letters, including several highly expressive insights about writing and literary criticism.''In a footnote, the appeal court's decision cited a letter in which Mr. Salinger complained about an editor who praised one of his stories while rejecting it. ''Like saying,'' he wrote, ''she's a beautiful girl, except for her face.''Another letter criticized Wendell Willkie, the 1940 Presidential candidate, saying, ''He looks to me like a guy who makes his wife keep a scrapbook for him.''The decision included another footnote referring to a 1943 letter in which ''Salinger, distressed that Oona O'Neill, whom he had dated, had married Charlie Chaplin, expressed his disapproval of the marriage in this satirical invention of his imagination:''I can see them at home evenings. Chaplin squatting grey and nude, atop his chiffonier, swinging his thyroid around his head by his bamboo cane, like a dead rat. Oona in an aquamarine gown, applauding madly from the bathroom.''''I'm facetious,'' the letter added, ''but I'm sorry. Sorry for anyone with a profile as young and lovely as Oona's.'' One Judge DiedJudge Jon O. Newman wrote the decision, with the concurrence of Judge Roger J. Miner, for the three-judge panel that heard the appeal. The third member of the panel, Judge Walter R. Mansfield, died on Jan. 7 while the case was under consideration.In reversing a ruling that Judge Pierre N. Leval issued on Nov. 5 in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the appeals court declared yesterday that the biography could not be published in its present form.''The plaintiff J. D. Salinger,'' the appeals court noted, ''is a highly regarded American novelist and short-story writer, best known for his novel 'The Catcher in the Rye.' He has not published since 1965 and has chosen to shun all publicity and inquiry concerning his private life.''''The defendant Ian Hamilton is a well respected writer on literary topics,'' it continued. ''He serves as literary critic of The London Sunday Times and has authored a biography of the poet Robert Lowell.''Mr. Hamilton, who wrote the biography despite Mr. Salinger's refusal to cooperate with him, made use of the unpublished Salinger letters, which were written between 1939 and 1961. The recipients or their representatives donated the letters to university libraries, where they were discovered by Mr. Hamilton. Salnger Obtained CopyrightWhen Mr. Salinger learned that the letters were being used in the biography, he registered them for copyright protection and objected to the biography's publication unless all of the material from the letters was deleted.In response to Mr. Salinger's objection, the appeals court observed, Mr. Hamilton and Random House revised the original galleys of the biography by paraphrasing much of the material that had previously been quoted from the letters.The appeals court countinued, however, that Mr. Salinger identified 59 instances where the revised biography contained ''passages that either quote from or closely paraphrase portions of the unpublished letters.''Mr. Salinger then sued the biographer and publisher, charging that the use of his letters involved copyright infringement and unfair competition.Judge Leval of the lower court rejected Mr. Salinger's request for an injunction in the suit, ruling last November that the biography had made only minimal use of material that was entitled to copyright protection. But he temporarily held up publication to permit an appeal.In the subsequent decision by the appeals court, Judge Newman noted that ''the author of letters is entitled to a copyright in the letters, as with any other work of literary authorship.'' 'The Heart of the Book'Under the copyright law, the appeals court said, a publisher can make ''fair use'' of unpublished works. But it said the biography's extensive use of ''close paraphrases'' of the Salinger letters had gone beyond the permitted limits.''The copied passages, if not the heart of the book,'' the opinion said, ''are at least an important ingredient of the book as it now stands. To a large extent, they make the book worth reading.''Although Mr. Salinger has indicated that he would not publish his letters in his lifetime, the appeals court said he was entitled to protect his opportunity to sell them.",9360844,9360860

On Wednesday, a senior White House official refused to make such a direct link, although he said Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon were involved in earlier kidnappings of Americans.Mr. Shultz's statement today was his latest assertion that Iran is still involved in terrorist activities. Soon after secret Iran arms deals were disclosed in November, President Reagan said there was no recent evidence of Iranian-backed terrorism against Americans. But Mr. Shultz has consistently said Iran is behind the seizing of American hostages in Lebanon. Groups Said to Have LinksMr. Shultz implied that the groups that have taken responsibility for kidnapping eight Americans now held in Lebanon have links to one another.Asked whether a new group was responsible for the most recent kidnapping of Americans, Mr. Shultz said: ''It is our basic information that whatever names may emerge, they are to a substantial degree linked together. And we also observe some very strong ties to Iran.''Mr. Shultz also called for a ''prompt decision'' by West Germany to extradite Mohammed Ali Hamadei, a Lebanese accused of terrorism whose arrest in West Germany seems to have touched off the recent wave of hostage-taking.The West German Government has not acted on an American request for the extradition of Mr. Hamadei, who is under indictment in the United States in the 1985 hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet to Beirut in which an American Navy diver, Robert Dean Stethem, was killed.Mr. Shultz rejected the notion that the United States would try to win the release of the hostages by dropping its demand that Mr. Hamadei be extradited. 'We Must Follow Through'''Our efforts and request for extradition stands,'' he said. ''And I am sure that it will continue to stand.''He added, ''If someone is indicted and there is evidence of complicity in a dire crime, the hijacking of an airplane and the murder of one of its occupants and the virtual torture of others, in a civilized society we must follow through and punish such crimes.''Mr. Shultz's remarks are part of what other State Department officials have characterized as an effort to focus attention on the kidnappers and on how to punish them instead of on the plight of the hostages. On Wednesday, the Reagan Administration barred travel to Lebanon on American passports because the threat of kidnappings was so great.One State Department official said that Mr. Reagan's statement of Nov. 13, in which he said Iran had not been involved in terrorist acts against Americans in the 18 months before the secret arms dealings were revealed, was ''an aberration, a big mistake.''Because of Iran's support of terrorism, the official said, Administration efforts toward improving relations with Iran are not going forward. Little Is Known About GroupOn Wednesday, a previously unknown group calling itself Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine took responsibility for kidnapping four teachers, three of them Americans, from the campus of Beirut University College. The group's name, and the fact that its communique did not begin with the Koranic verse customarily used by Islamic Holy War in communications about hostages, indicated a Palestinian connection, according to sources in Lebanon.Nevertheless, State Department officials said they are convinced this new group is linked to the Party of God, a loosely organized militant group of Lebanese Shiites who the State Department officials say receive military training and financial, ideological and logistical support from Iran. The Party of God is believed to have been behind the kidnappings of other Americans in Lebanon and a number of terrorist bombings since 1985 in Western Europe.Mr. Hamadei is also believed to have links to the Party of God. Small Cell IdentifiedAdministration officials acknowledge that there is much they do not know about the organization. On Wednesday, a senior Administration official identified for the first time a small cell within the Party of God, headed by Imad Mughniyah, that he said may have been responsible for the most recent kidnapping of Americans. Mr. Mughniyah is under indictment in the United States as having planned and directed the T.W.A. hijacking in which Mr. Hamadei is charged.Other officials who closely watch terrorist groups in Lebanon say Mr. Mughniyah is one of the people who has met in the past with Terry Waite, the envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury who has sought to negotiate the release of hostages in Lebanon. But they say Mr. Mughniyah is only one of the leaders of loosely-linked factions within the Party of God that are holding the hostages.These factions are competing for status, money and other support from various groups in Iran, and the kidnapping of hostages may be a part of this strategy, these officials add. A Show of FirmnessMr. Shultz's remarks are designed in part to show Iran's leaders that the United States has not relaxed its policy on terrorism, said one State Department official, particularly since a number of Iranian leaders have made statements recently praising President Reagan's remarks that Iran has not instigated terrorist acts against Americans, and citing those remarks as a helpful step in improving relations.In a related move today, the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said the risk to American citizens in Lebanon was so great that the United States should close its embassy in Beirut and withdraw its diplomats.''The security situation in Lebanon has deteriorated so badly, and our influence of events there is so minimal, it is hard to see how the embassy can play any useful role,'' he told the Senate.The Senate Democratic leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, has also said it is time to close the embassy.Meanwhile, the United States continued to reinforce its naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. Two aircraft carrier battle groups are in the Mediterranean as ''precautionary moves to insure that the President has all options available to him that he might choose,'' a Defense Department spokesman, Robert Sims, said today.In addition, the five-ship Mediterranean Amphibious Readiness Group in the Atlantic will arrive in Rota, Spain, on Saturday, in what Mr. Sims described as a routine rotation.",9360934,9361201,9360836,9360933,9360846,9361196

Now, he says, he is enjoying the good.Eamonn Coghlan has known the bad days. Now, he says, he is enjoying the good.''I feel very well,'' he said yesterday. ''Training is going good. No aches, no pains, no injuries.''No youth, either. Eamonn Coghlan, the king, or former king, of the indoor milers, is 34 years old. That is a good age for a physician or a lawyer or a stockbroker. It is also a good age, said Coghlan, for someone who intends to win the Wanamaker Mile tonight in Madison Square Garden.The Wanamaker Mile is the traditional feature of the Wanamaker Millrose Games, the most celebrated meet in indoor track. Coghlan won it six times between 1977 and 1985. That ties the record of Glenn Cunningham, who won six times between 1933 and 1939.Four of the eight starters are from Ireland - Marcus O'Sullivan, who won last year; Coghlan, Ray Flynn and Frank O'Mara. The others are Steve Ovett of England, Jose Abascal of Spain, Kip Cheruyiot of Kenya and Mark Fricker, the only American. Fricker is the designated rabbit, the one who will try to set a fast pace for the first three-quarters of the race. Ran Fastest Indoor MileCoghlan, with his roaring finishes, may be the most popular indoor miler since Cunningham. In 1983, Coghlan ran the fastest indoor mile ever - 3 minutes 49.78 in the Vitalis Olympic Invitational in East Rutherford, N.J. He won the world championship at 5,000 meters that summer in Helsinki, Finland.Since then, he has become a victim of his body. Both shinbones have suffered stress fractures. A diet he thought would make him stronger made him weaker. A month ago, a dog took five bites out of him, and in trying to ward off the dog he broke his left hand.This is his second mile race of the indoor season. Two Saturdays ago, in Johnson City, Tenn., he won in 3:56.59. He plans to run in about six meets this winter, including the Olympic Invitational Feb. 14 and perhaps the USA/Mobil national indoor championships Feb. 27 in the Garden.His big goal is the 3,000 meters in the first world indoor championships March 6-8 in Indianapolis. His goal outdoors is the 10,000 meters in the world championships Aug. 29 through Sept. 6 in Rome. His immediate goal is atonement.''I want to re-establish myself after a very poor 1986,'' he said. ''I was just trying too hard. It started with that diet in the fall of 1985. I wasn't trying to lose weight, just to eat better, but my weight dropped from 150 to 135. I got a stomach virus. I had dysentery right through the 1986 outdoor season. From Bad to Worst''The more I tried, the worse I got. For every step forward, I took two steps backward. I think I was eating too much fiber and trying to run 15 miles a day with little fuel in my body. All the power went out of my legs, especially my thighs. The first thing I lost was my kick, and you know how important that is to me.''Last indoor season, Coghlan ran six races on the circuit and lost all six. Outdoors, he won his first two races - the 10,000 meters at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia and the 3,000 meters in the Bruce Jenner meet in San Jose, Calif. But he did not feel well either time, and after that it was more disaster. In one race, at 5,000 meters in Zurich, he finished last.He returned to Ireland for tests that showed he was completely run down. His ability to use oxygen had decreased 10 percent. Dr. Moira O'Brien, the physician for the Irish Olympic team, told him to take a complete break for a month.''She said I should do anything I wanted to except run,'' he said. ''So I did. I drank beer. I took off five weeks, and I felt better. But I still had aches in the groin and lower back. They were so bad that I would sit on the floor with my kids and I couldn't reach over to play with them.''In mid-September, he started a strength program that relieved the aches. He did so much stretching that the problems cleared up and he could put on his trousers without pain.''Now I have no backaches,'' he said. ''Everything is good. I may be 34, but if you don't have a good attitude and desire you won't do it at any age. I'm still young.'' ---- Meet Begins at 5:50 The Millrose meet will start with the masters mile relay at 5:50 P.M. and end with the featured college and club mile relay at 10:55. A handful of tickets remained last night. . . . The men's fields include Carl Lewis and Lee McRae in the 60-yard dash, Renaldo Nehemiah and Greg Foster in the 60-yard high hurdles, Antonio McKay and Roddie Haley in the 400 meters, Elvis Forde in the 600 yards, Peter Elliott and Sammy Koskei in the 1,000 meters, Doug Padilla and Jim Spivey in the 3,000 meters, Jim Howard and Doug Nordquist in the high jump and Joe Dial and Earl Bell in the pole vault.Among the women are Evelyn Ashford in the 60-yard dash, Stephanie Hightower and Jackie Joyner Kersee in the 60-yard hurdles, Diane Dixon and Lillie Leatherwood in the 400 meters and Louise Ritter and Debbie Brill in the high jump.",9361183

The company said yesterday that the decision to drop the bid had been caused by delays in getting approval from the Federal Communications Commission.A Gencorp spokesman said the F.C.C. had set no time as to when Westinghouse could expect a decision.Gencorp has agreed to sell 13 broadcast properties to various buyers. In each case there are challenges to the transfer of licenses. Westinghouse, in its agreement, reserved the right to cancel the deal if there were no settlement by Jan. 31.Westinghouse said it would continue to seek other broadcast properties. It already owns five TV stations that are affiliated with networks.In recent months, independent TV stations have been hurt by rising programming costs and declining advertising revenues. The ratings of KHJ-TV, however, have risen this season and its profitability has increased, according to a Gencorp spokesman.Nevertheless, the long-term outlook for independents is considered less positive than it once was. Several analysts familiar with Westinghouse believe that may have been a consideration in the company's decision.Gencorp had said it would use money from the sale of properties to repurchase its stock. Donald F. DeScenze of Nomura Securities said that he believed the buyback program might now be delayed six months.On news of the Westinghouse decision, Gencorp's stock fell $5.125, to $71.625, with 1.2 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.COMPANY NEWS",9361071,9360840,9360879

But because the House of Representatives does not plan to vote on the question, the raises are virtually certain to take effect at 12:01 A.M.The Senate voted tonight to block the pay increases President Reagan proposed for members of Congress, Federal judges and high-level officials in the executive branch. But because the House of Representatives does not plan to vote on the question, the raises are virtually certain to take effect at 12:01 A.M. next Wednesday.A 1985 Federal law, designed to insulate Congress from the politically sensitive question of its own pay, provides that the President's salary recommendations automatically take effect in 30 days unless both houses of Congress vote to block the increases.The vote in the Senate to block the increases was 87 to 7.Senators freely conceded today that the daylong debate was little more than political theater. To try to force the House to vote on the pay issue, the Senate in a separate voice vote tonight added an amendment blocking the raise to a bill that releases $50 million in emergency Federal aid to the homeless. The House passed that bill earlier this week, and the two versions will have to be worked out in a conference committee. But the House is not obliged to deal with the issue until after Tuesday, when the raises will have taken effect.However, because the Constitution prohibits decreasing the pay of Federal judges, the judges' increases could not be canceled once they took effect.Under the proposals, the President submitted as part of his budget, salaries for senators and representatives would increase from the current $77,400 a year to $89,500. Federal district judges' salaries would increase from $81,100 to $89,500, and those for appellate judges would go from $85,700 to $95,000. There would be smaller increases for several levels of top executive branch officials. Leaders Supported IncreasesBoth the Senate and House leadership supported the increases, which the President scaled back sharply from recommendations made last month by a special nine-member commission. Rules in the House give the leadership great control over the calendar. But the Senate leadership has less control, and Senator Robert C. Byrd, the majority leader, had little choice but to permit a vote on a resolution to disapprove the pay increases.The resolution was sponsored by Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina. There were 17 co-sponsors.''Today our national debt exceeds $2 trillion,'' Senator Thurmond said. ''Stated simply, it is not an appropriate time for members of Congress to vote ourselves or any other high level officials a pay raise.''Congress should not approve a pay rise, he continued, ''until such time as we fulfill our responsibility to the American people to balance the Federal budget.''The raises were defended by Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio. He stressed that members of Congress and the other officials covered by the raises have lost 40 percent of their earning power since 1969.''There will always be people willing to serve in Congress,'' Senator Glenn said. ''But we don't want just anybody. We want the best. You get what you pay for.''He said the problem was particularly acute for the Federal bench. Top lawyers are increasingly reluctant to accept nominations as judges, Senator Glenn said.However, he opposed an amendment offered by Senator Pete Wilson, Republican of California, to permit the raises to take effect for judges and executive branch officials, blocking the increases only for members of Congress.That approach ''sort of sets us apart as a lesser branch of Government,'' Senator Glenn said, adding, ''I don't believe we are second-class citizens.'' The Wilson amendment was defeated by a vote of 27 to 67. Weicker Amendment DefeatedThe Senate also defeated an amendment by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut, to raise Congressional pay to $120,000 a year while prohibiting members to accept fees for outside speaking and writing.Senate rules now permit senators to keep honoraria totaling 30 percent of their salary, and last year 65 senators earned at least $20,000 in outside fees.Senator Weicker said that senators would be able to earn $125,000 a year in salary and honorariums if the President's proposal was adopted and no change was made in the 30 percent limit.He said the question was ''whether our salaries will be paid entirely by the taxpayers or in part by the taxpayers and in part by special interests.'' He read a list of two dozen groups that had given him speaking fees last year. ''Every senator here had different groups,'' he said. ''Does that make everybody feel comfortable?'' His amendment lost by a vote of 93 to 2.",9361278,9360836,9360984,9361214,9360846

Their accord came after the United States and France reached an ambiguous compromise on what priority agriculture should have in the talks.Representatives of nearly 100 industrial and developing nations finally agreed today to start important trade-freeing negotiations next month. Their accord came after the United States and France reached an ambiguous compromise on what priority agriculture should have in the talks.The agreement, achieved in all-night bargaining here, came after the member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -the world body overseeing trade -failed to meet a Dec. 19 deadline for organizing the new round because of procedural differences.Last September GATT trade ministers agreed in principle to hold trade-freeing negotiations - dubbed the Uruguay Round, after the country where they met. But they left trade officials to work out the all-important details of how the new talks would be organized. Delegates Show OptimismToday delegates expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting here and optimism about the future. ''We have got everything we need for a successful start,'' said the chief American negotiator, Michael Samuels.The GATT Director General, Arthur Dunkel, called the negotiators ''courageous'' for undertaking a new trade round in today's difficult economic climate.The Uruguay Round, the eighth such effort GATT countries have made since World War II, is intended to roll back a tide of protectionism throughout the world. It will also extend liberal GATT principles to new fields, including trade in services such as insurance and in international investment.Today's detailed agreement proved difficult to reach because of deep-seated suspicions among several GATT members. France's Cautious StanceIn particular, France fears that the United States and other big crop-exporting nations plan to turn the negotiations into an assault on the European Community's protectionist farm policy, which France favors.In addition, a group of developing nations led by India and Brazil dislike the Reagan Administration's plans for liberalizing trade in services and investment, which they fear will harm their development and increase the third world's economic dependence on industrial nations.The Reagan Administration is also opposed to efforts by the developing world to liberalize trade in textiles by breaking open the recently renewed Multi-Fiber Arrangement, an international pact that regulates exports of clothing from the third world to developed nations.Under today's agreement, GATT countries are committed to put forward by the end of this year detailed plans for liberalizing trade in 11 categories. Completion by 1990 SoughtThese include trade in agricultural and tropical products as well as proposals for further cuts in tariffs and administrative barriers to trade and plans for dealing with subsidies.Detailed bargaining on the basis of these national proposals will begin in 1988, with the GATT members committed to winding up the whole Uruguay Round by 1990.However, the negotiating plan for agriculture remains ambiguous as a result of a deep quarrel between the United States and France.GATT nations have agreed to present plans this year for freeing world trade in farm products. At French insistence, however, they have avoided a rigid commitment to open real negotiations on agricultural trade next year. Instead they have merely agreed on ''further examination'' of the proposals they make and to ''initiation of negotiations.''Officials say France wants to avoid a binding commitment before its national elections in May next year.",9361009,9360983
http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,CONTRAS ARE FOCUS IN 7 INVESTIGATIONS,"LEAD: Several Federal agencies are pressing at least seven criminal investigations of the Nicaraguan rebels and their American backers, even as President Reagan is urging Congress to provide new aid for the contras.Several Federal agencies are pressing at least seven criminal investigations of the Nicaraguan rebels and their American backers, even as President Reagan is urging Congress to provide new aid for the contras.A review of the investigations has uncovered several previously undisclosed charges - so far unproved - involving the contras as well as investigations that had not been known.For example, Congressional sources disclosed this week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened a criminal investigation to determine what happened to most of the $27 million for nonlethal supplies for the rebels that Congress approved in 1985. A General Accounting Office report published earlier said most of it could not be traced.Investigators also disclosed in the last several days that the G.A.O. had begun a separate inquiry into the whereabouts of millions of dollars that were apparently supposed to be funneled to the contras in Nicaragua from the sale of American weapons to Iran.Other open investigations, most of them previously known, focus on charges that the contras or their backers smuggled arms, trafficked in drugs, laundered money or violated the Neutrality Act, which bars Americans from involvement in military efforts against countries not at war with the United States.In addition to these inquiries, a special prosecutor and two Congressional committees examining the Iran-contra affair are investigating charges of illegality tied to the contras. New Aid SoughtThe investigations pose a dilemma for the Reagan Adminstration. As it pushes for additional support for the contras, the Administration is also compelled by statute to investigate reports that the rebels might have broken the law. The Administration is asking Congress for $105 million in aid for the contras for the fiscal year that begins next October.Investigators say President Reagan's outspoken public support for the contras has made it difficult for prosecutors and other Federal agents to carry on their work. Law enforcement officials have repeatedly denied accusations that, because of Administration pressure, their inquiries were unnecessarily slow or incomplete.The investigations are being conducted by a variety of agencies, including the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Customs Service and the General Accounting Office, among others. Prosecutor May Take OverA number of the investigations are expected to be turned over to the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra case, Lawrence E. Walsh. In announcing his appointment as independent counsel, a three-judge panel asked Mr. Walsh to investigate the sale of weapons to Iran and the reports by the White House that millions of dollars in profits from the sales had been diverted to the contras.He was also given authority to study charges that the contras received other possibly illegal support in their war against the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua.These are the Federal investigations known to involve the contras or their supporters:* An investigation by the United States Attorney in Miami of charges that weapons were smuggled to the contras from a Florida airport in 1985.* An investigation by the same office of a Miami-based cargo carrier that has been involved both in the Iran arms sales and the secret efforts to supply the contras.* An investigation in Georgia of the sale of four small planes, including one reportedly sold to the contras in 1985.* A criminal investigation of what happened to the $27 million Congress granted to the rebels in 1985.* A separate investigation by the General Accounting Office of the Iran arms case.* A Federal investigation of charges that the Americans taking arms to the rebels also smuggled drugs.* An F.B.I. investigation of a burglary at the offices of a group that has opposed the Administration's policies in Central America. Arms Smuggling ChargedThe United States Attorney in Miami, Leon B. Kellner, has been involved in two of the most widely publicized investigations.The first, begun in 1985, involves allegations that a large quantity of weapons were smuggled to the contras from an airport in Fort Lauderdale. The purported shipment could have been a violation of the Neutrality Act.Early last year, prosecutors were confronted with charges from a man who asserted that he had helped in the shipment. The witness, Jesus Garcia, was then in prison awaiting sentence on weapons charges.With information from the F.B.I. and the statements by Mr. Garcia, Mr. Kellner's office opened an investigation that continued through 1986. A grand jury took the case last fall.The inquiry has been subjected to criticism from, among others, Senator John D. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat whose office has studied the case. He has said that the investigation moved too slowly and that valuable witnesses and evidence were ignored.But Justice Department officials, including Mr. Kellner, have denied the charges. They say the inquiry has been hindered because, in some cases, witnesses have offered one account to reporters and lawmakers, but are unwilling to provide the same account to prosecutors. Pressure by Meese DeniedThe officials note, for example, that no witness have been able to offer testimony indicating that they saw anything more than a few large weapons being loaded in Fort Lauderdale. News accounts have indicated that tons of arms were sent from the Florida airport.Mr. Kellner denied reports indicating that he had come under pressure from Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d to delay the investigation to prevent damage to the Administration's contra-support campaign.The second investigation by Mr. Kellner's office involves Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based cargo carrier involved in both the Iran arms sale and the secret efforts to supply the contras. According to law-enforcement officials, the Customs Service in Miami brought the case to Mr. Kellner late last year.The Customs inquiry, involving potential violations of Federal arms export laws, was prompted by the crash in Nicaragua last October of a C-123 cargo plane containing weapons meant for the contras. Crewman Seized by NicaraguaThe only surviving member of the four-man crew, Eugene Hasenfus, was released by the Nicaraguan Government last month and has been extensively questioned by the Customs Service and the F.B.I. The special House committee investigating the Iran-contra affair questioned Mr. Hasenfus today.In interviews, Mr. Hasenfus has said he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. Southern Air, formerly owened by the C.I.A., has acknowledged that it held a contract to service planes used in the operation.According to officials, F.B.I. agents have begun a separate investigation of the C-123 crash, although their inquiry has not yet resulted in a grand-jury review in Miami.The Customs and F.B.I. investigations were suspended for more than three weeks last autumn at the direction of Attorney General Meese. Mr. Meese said he sought the delay at the urging of Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser.The propriety of the delay is now under investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and by the F.B.I., officials disclosed.In Macon, Ga., the Customs Service and the United States Attorney's office have led an investigation into the sale of four small-engined planes, including one that was reportedly sold to contra forces in 1985. The short takeoff and landing planes were manufactured by Maule Air Inc. of Moultrie, Ga. One was bought in 1984 by a company then headed by a retired Air Force major general, Richard V. Secord. General Denies WrongdoingGeneral Secord has emerged as a leading figure in the dispute over arms sales to Iran and the diversion of funds to the contras. He is also reported to have had extensive involvement in efforts to supply the contras.According to published accounts, General Secord has acknowledged that his company sold the plane for $49,000 to the contras in 1985. But in an interview today, General Secord's lawyer, Thomas C. Green, said he had no knowledge that the plane had been sold to the contras. The general, he said, ''emphatically'' denies wrongdoing.Justice Department officials would not discuss other details of the case, although they said that a grand jury in Macon was trying to determine if exports laws had been violated in the sale.Congressional aides say the F.B.I. in Washington is also conducting a criminal investigation to find out what happened to the $27 million in ''humanitarian assistance'' Congress granted to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985. The investigation followed a report last year by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that said investigators had been unable to determine what happened to nearly two-thirds of the money.According to the report, investigators found at least one instance in which money was spent on ammunition and grenades, a violation of the Congressional act that provided the aid. Arms Deal InvestigatedAt the request of at least three lawmakers, the G.A.O. has begun a separate, extensive investigation into the Iran arms deal and what happened to the profits, some of which were supposedly intended for the contras.Officials on Capitol Hill said the G.A.O. had been asked to determine exactly what had happened to the money paid by Iran. Tens of millions of dollars from the sale are still unaccounted for.''The bottom line is that the G.A.O. is supposed to find out where the hell that money is,'' one official said.The drug-related investigation concerns evidence uncovered last year that the military supply operation to the rebels also smuggled drugs on the return trips.According to Administration officials, investigators in El Salvador acting on information from the D.E.A. learned that the American flight crews covertly ferrying arms to the rebels returned to the United States by way of Panama, a major drug transshipment center, to pick up cocaine and marijuana. The special White House Commission investigating the Iran-contra affair is studying this allegation, officials said.The Justice Department announced this month that it had requested the F.B.I. investigation into a burgarly last November at the offices of a prominent Washington political group that has opposed the Administration's policies in Central America.Organizations opposed to the contras are hoping that the bureau's investigation will be expanded to study 35 similar incidents that have been documented around the country over the last two years. The groups have said the break-ins might have been organized by conservative groups supporting the Nicaraguan rebels.For the moment, however, the Justice Department has said it will deal only with the break-in at the Washington offices of the International Center for Development Policy. The center has said that its files were ransacked.",9360934,9361315,9361359,9360995,9360836,9360933,9361141,9361204,9360868,9361203,9360846

If anyone can use the vast, reverberant space within the cathedral to improve their music, it might be the improvising duo of Don Cherry and Nana Vasconcelos. Mr. Cherry made groundbreaking records in the 1960's as the puckish trumpeter in Ornette Coleman's jazz quartets. Since then, he has delved into world music, listening to Latin, Caribbean, Arabian and African music and adding keyboards and doussn'gouni (African hunter's harp) to his collection of instruments. Mr. Vasconcelos, a Brazilian percussionist, can play anything that shakes, rattles, rings or taps; he and Mr. Cherry are longtime collaborators who bring out each other's humor and willingness to take risks. For this duo, the cathedral's echo should just be one more plaything. Tonight at 8; tickets are $10. Sam Rivers and the Rivbea Orchestra, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street (242-1785). The saxophonist-flutist-pianist-composer Sam Rivers has been an iconoclastic force in new jazz for nearly three decades, working in every style from free-form trio improvisation to short, snappy tunes that are as concise as pop songs. He gets the chance to convene a big band only once every few years, but when he does he attracts some of the city's best players. With reed, brass and rhythm sections at his disposal, Mr. Rivers has written dense, knotty compositions as well as pieces that sound like slightly warped mainstream big-band music. This time, he is likely to have new approaches as well. Tonight and tomorrow at 10 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M; there is a $12 cover and a $6 minimum.Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Mikell's, 760 Columbus Avenue, at 97th Street (864-8832). Since the 1950's, Art Blakey has been equally celebrated as a drummer - with a steamroller beat and his distinctive, crescendoing snare-drum roll that pushes soloists to their limits - and as a talent scout, finding unknown young horn players and pianists who would grow up to be as influential as Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Horace Silver and the Marsalis brothers. His current Jazz Messengers will perform tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is a $12 cover and a two-drink minimum.Rock Album of the Week: ''T Bone Burnett'' (MCA/Dot): T Bone Burnett has made albums that draw on rockabilly, pop, rock and honky-tonk, but with ''T Bone Burnett'' he aims for the unadorned directness of country ballads. His lyrics are clear, neither too clever nor too obvious: ''I had to run before I knew how to crawl/The first step was hard but I've had trouble with them all,'' he sings in ''River of Love.'' And the backup, recorded live (without overdubbing) in a studio with an unamplified string band - vocal harmonies, guitar, dobro, fiddle, string bass, plus an occasional accordion or a snare drum played with brushes - fills in the mood of melancholy resignation, while now and then a lyric glints with a spurned lover's resentment. As more and more rockers pay lip service to the directness of old-fashioned country music, ''T Bone Burnett'' proves that simplicity can still yield emotional depth. The album is a quiet gem.",9361206,9361292,9360939

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,TRADE PACT IS SET WITH EUROPEANS,"LEAD: The United States and the European Community reached an accord today resolving a major trade conflict over American grain exports to Spain.The United States and the European Community reached an accord today resolving a major trade conflict over American grain exports to Spain.After three days of marathon talks, mostly by trans-Atlantic telephone, the Europeans agreed to compensate Washington for losses on agricultural and industrial trade caused by levies that Spain imposed when it joined the community last year. The United States had contended that the levies cost it about $430 million in lost corn and sorghum sales.The 11th-hour pact, still needing formal ratification by the community's members, appeared to end a year-old dispute that had threatened to become a full-fledged trade war. The White House had vowed to impose 200 percent tariffs on such European goods as cheese and inexpensive white wine unless an agreement was signed by midnight Friday. Working on RatificationOfficials from the 12 community nations were meeting here tonight to ratify the accord, with their approval expected before the deadline.The dispute had also clouded plans for new talks by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on liberalizing world commerce, but GATT representatives agreed in Geneva today to start the Uruguay Round next month.  [ Page D2. ]  The Brussels accord was welcomed by Willy de Clercq, the European Community's External Relations Commissioner. ''This is a political solution that solves a problem that could have led to a trade war,'' he said. ''It could have spiraled and dragged in the rest of the world.''Diplomats from both sides declined to put a dollar value on the four-year pact, but it appeared to be favorable to the United States.The centerpiece of the pact calls for the European Community to allow annual shipments of 2 million metric tons of corn and 300,000 metric tons of sorghum to Spain at low tariffs. Portugal Also AffectedThe agreement also requires Portugal to end its practice, which began when it entered the community last year, of favoring grain imports from other community members.The United States is expected to garner about two-thirds of the new quotas, which apply to all exporters outside the European Community. As for corn and sorghum, the most important products, this means 1.6 million to 1.7 million tons of exports to Spain, compared with 2.8 million tons before the Spanish levies began.The accord also requires the European Community to reduce tariffs on several hundred million dollars of American industrial exports to Europe. The 26 products that will benefit from lower levies include dried onions, roasted nuts, aluminum sheet, cigars, silicon wafers, plywood, plant seeds and certain chemicals.American and European officials here were unsure exactly how much industrial sales would increase. European Reaction MixedAmong leaders of European industry, initial reaction to the agreement was mixed. There was a widespread impression that the community had yielded to pressure from Washington.''We prefer this to a trade war that would never finish - there would be no winners,'' one European grain official said. ''But what's bad is that we made concessions. The community always ends up by accepting the will of the Americans.''At a news conference, Mr. de Clercq conceded some bitterness over the ''extremely difficult'' negotiations with Clayton K. Yeutter, America's special trade representative. U.S. OFFICIALS PLEASED  WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (Special to The New York Times) - American officials said today that they were pleased with the Brussels trade agreement.The nation's deputy trade representative, Alan Woods, estimated that the tariff cuts could ultimately increase American exports by $70 million to $100 million a year.

The appeal was rebuffed in advance by Iran, which boycotted the meeting.The Kuwaiti hosts, who had lavished $400 million in a brand-new 99-acre center built for the conference and had provided amenities ranging from a $70 million runway to 90,000 pots of chrysanthemums, were delighted that the conference went ahead without incident despite threats by fundamentalist groups.But the more than 30 resolutions, including one for a committee to follow up peace overtures in the gulf war, were an evasive and sometimes contradictory lot. Two Voices on TerrorismThe four-day meeting, for instance, adopted a Kuwaiti-sponsored resolution condemning ''criminal terrorism,'' but also a Syrian-backed resolution calling for a United Nations conference to define terrorism. Kuwait has had several terrorist incidents, including a suicide car bomb attack on its ruling Emir, and Syria has been accused of supporting terrorists.Similarly, one resolution called for the formation of a ''preparatory committee'' to look into the possibilty of Middle East peace conference, a gesture toward Egypt, and another condemned separate dealings with Israel, a gesture toward Syria.Given the divisions, there was a gloomy undercurrent, expressed in a speech by King Hussein of Jordan.''We have lost the respect of the rest of the world,'' he said, ''and have been further weakened in the eyes of our enemies. We have been easy targets for enemy adventurers, an unresisting prey to be divided by the superpowers or exploited by the minipowers and the arms salesmen. What value is Islamic solidarity if Moslems continue to slay one another?''Egypt appeared to have gained the most from the conference, for the presence of President Hosni Mubarak was seen as a step toward Egypt's rejoining the Arab fold. It has been formally shunned since its peace treaty with Israel.But a meeting of five Arab leaders on Wednesday to plan a long-postponed summit meeting was reported to have fallen apart over objections from Saudi Arabia.Although the Moslem world includes Asian and African countries, Arab issues predominated. Meetings on the SidelinesThere were several meetings on the sidelines of Arab leaders who have been at odds with one another - Mr. Mubarak with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Assad with President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon, and King Hussein with the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat - but they appeared likely to have little lasting effect.Many participants were disappointed. Despite the standard attacks on Israel and calls for the ''liberation'' of Jerusalem and Palestine, Mr. Arafat and his P.L.O. entourage were embittered over what they saw as a lack of Arab support, particularly for the Palestinian guerrillas battling Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem militiamen in Lebanon.At the same time, King Hussein, who was seeking to supplant Mr. Arafat's political influence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, received a setback when Saudi Arabia, instead of contributing to the King's five-year development plan, gave $9 million to revive the joint P.L.O.-Jordanian Fund, which has long been dormant.Security was tight throughout the conference, with admittance by one of 19 color-coded badges. Metal detectors were turned up so high that people had to go through without eyeglasses or shoes, and the Kuwaitis ordered fishermen not to go out to sea and post offices not to accept parcels.",9360848,9360888,9360868

Kellner, the chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, said. ''This will reverberate throughout the economy.''Many economists said it was one of the first concrete signs that the economic recovery suggested by Wall Street's bull market might be on the way. ''I think the stock market is now talking about a robust 1988, and I think that's what this number is about,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. One-Time Factors NotedHowever, some analysts warned that the December jump in durable orders might have been influenced by ususual events that would make the increase less significant. They cited, for example, the year-end auto-buying spree by consumers seeking to take advantage of sales-tax deductions under the old tax law.Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said: ''When you add it all up, the economy isn't booming, and it's not busting based on these numbers. It's just muddling along.''Durable goods are manufactured products expected to last at least three years. They include such things as machinery, airplanes, and appliances. An increase in orders for durable orders often indicates that the economy is beginning to move.After a time lag of six months to a year, new orders can lead to increased employment. That, in turn, brings new spending.The report could be a sign that the Reagan Administration's effort to help reduce the nation's huge trade deficit by allowing the dollar to sag may be working, according to Robert A. Kavesh, an economics professor at New York University Graduate School of Business. As American products become less expensive, orders may rise.Professor Kavesh said strong orders in certain categories, including steel, indicated new foreign buying. Trade figures for December will be released today.",9360990,9360930,9360868

Of the two separate elimination trials, Conner's San Diego Yacht Club won the right to challenge Australia's Royal Perth Yacht Club for the America's Cup.The first race is scheduled to begin at 1:15 P.M. local time. Because of the 13-hour time difference between Fremantle and the Eastern time zone in the United States, the race starts at 12:15 Saturday morning New York time. ESPN, the cable network, plans to show each of the three- to four-hour races live, with the broadcast beginning at 11 P.M. Friday evening. Duel Starts With Warning GunTen minutes before the start, a warning gun will open a duel between the two boats and the skippers to see which will have the advantage at the start, an advantage in match racing that - barring a glaring error or a gear failure - could mean all the difference in the 24.3-nautical-mile race.Conner, the 44-year-old San Diego sailor who is the skipper of Stars & Stripes, has made no secret of the fact that winning the America's Cup has been a three-year obsession. As skipper of the Liberty in 1983, Conner and his 10-man crew were beaten by the Royal Perth Yacht Club's Australia II and lost the cup, which had been held for 132 years by the New York Yacht Club since John Cox Stevens won the silver trophy in a race around England's Isle of Wight in 1851.Conner is manager of a syndicate that has spent close to $15 million in its quest to regain the cup. Set up as the Sail America Foundation, the team found a sponsor in the San Diego Yacht Club and financial support from major corporations and private donors. The group built four new boats and Stars & Stripes is the best of the lot, a slate-blue speedster that Conner has designed to sail best in the blustery winds that prevail on the cup course on the Indian Ocean.The Kookaburra syndicate, Taskforce '87, is backed by Kevin Parry, a millionaire businessman from Western Australia, who threw his financial weight behind the 28-year-old Murray.When the syndicate started out nearly three years ago, it was bucking the mighty establishment of Alan Bond, a veteran of a decade of America's Cup racing and whose radically different Australia II brought the cup here.Parry's syndicate spent more money - at least $18 million compared with Bond's $15 million - and built three new boats to Bond's two. Two weeks ago, it paid off when Kookaburra III defeated Australia IV for the right to defend the cup.Both Kookaburra III and Stars & Stripes have run separate gantlets. Both have survived as winners of elimination trials that knocked out the other multimillion-dollar syndicates one by one during a four-month period. Kookaburra III beat three other Australian syndicates; Conner eliminated 13 other boats for the right to challenge.The gold hull of Kookaburra III appears similar under sail to Stars & Stripes, and both are about 65 feet long. The differences between the 12-Meters - a designation that refers only to a complicated measurement rule - unfold underwater. Keels Are DifferentBoth boats weigh nearly the same, about 25 tons, but their lead keels take entirely different form. The exact configurations are closely held secrets, but photos taken of the boats under sail in the crystal ocean waters here reveal that both have winged appendages. Kookaburra III's wings are almost the beam of the boat in width. Stars & Stripes's are narrower to conform with an odd-shaped underbody that is fuller in the stern than Kookaburra III's. Despite their differences, the boats are close in speed.The 24.3-mile course contains four upwind legs on which the boats -which cannot sail directly into the wind - must zig-zag as close to the wind as they can to reach the mark. There are two reaching legs on which the wind comes across the boats and two downwind legs on which the wind comes from behind the boats. Stars & Stripes tends to excel on upwind legs; Kookaburra III would seem to be better downwind. On the reaches, the two boats seem about equal.The sails on each boat have identifying marks: Stars & Stripes carries the number US 55, Kookaburra III is KA 15. On the downwind legs, the boats carry spinnakers off the bow that are often the colors of their team. Stars & Stripes's spinnaker sailcloth tends to be white with red and blue stripes. Kookaburra III flies sails with yellow and green crossbars.THE AMERICA'S CUP",9361307

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,SENATORS CHARGE A WEB OF DECEIT IN IRANIAN AFFAIR,"LEAD: A report on the Iran-contra affair made public today by the Senate Intelligence Committee portrays Reagan Administration officials as regularly deceiving one another, as well as Congress, about major elements of the operation.A report on the Iran-contra affair made public today by the Senate Intelligence Committee portrays Reagan Administration officials as regularly deceiving one another, as well as Congress, about major elements of the operation.The report cites evidence that President Reagan was interested mainly in trading arms for hostages, and it reveals that some profits from the sale of arms to Iran may have been used by an Israeli official for ''other projects.'' It does not specify those projects.  [ Key sections, pages A8 and A9. ]  It also cites evidence that some profits were deposited in bank accounts controlled by Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and two retired officials of the Central Intelligence Agency, apparently for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. The three men are no longer in government. Before now, it had not been known exactly who controlled the accounts. No Conclusions Are DrawnThe 65-page document, a chronology beginning in early 1985 and continuing through this month, draws no conclusions. It was based on a three-week investigation by the Senate committee under Republican leadership last month. The investigation included testimony from 36 witnesses and the examination of thousands of pages of documents from the White House and other agencies.Earlier this month, the panel voted not to release a report that had been prepared by the Republican staff. The White House had urged release of that report.When Democrats gained control of the committee in the new Congress, the panel ''started afresh'' and prepared the document that was released today, according to the chairman, Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma. The White House also welcomed the release of this document.The report today does not introduce new players or dramatic new episodes. But it provides a fuller description and more details of events than earlier drafts obtained by news organizations.Senator Boren said the document was ''preliminary'' because key figures like Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter had refused to testify, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The two men, who were with the National Security Agency, were key agents in the United States-Iran talks.The Committee voted 14 to 1 today to publish the report. Senator Arlen Spector, Republican of Pennsylania, voted against publishing the report. A spokesman said the Senator did not have time to digest it fully.The report will be used, Mr. Boren said, as a foundation for a more extensive inquiry by a special Senate investigating committee. A special House committee is conducting a parallel investigation.The report cites evidence that disputes Mr. Reagan's contention that the main purpose of the arms deals was to open a relationship with moderate officials in Iran.The document says Colonel North, who directed the arms sales and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, told Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d that every time he mentioned Iranian moderates, Mr. Reagan returned to the hostage issue.''With the President, said North, it always came back to hostages,'' the report says. ''According to Meese, North said it was a terrible mistake to say that the President wanted a strategic relationship, because the President wanted the hostages.'' Examples of DeceptionThe report includes these examples, among others, indicating that Administration officials deceived one another and members of Congress:* Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, testified that he had specifically asked William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, whether Israel was secretly shipping arms to Iran in 1985. Mr. Casey, according to the testimony, replied that the Israelis were not sending arms, even though the C.I.A. had evidence of the shipments.* Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, told the committee in November that no money had been solicited from foreign countries to aid the Nicaraguan rebels. Later, according to the report, Mr. Abrams apologized to the committee for withholding the fact that such solicitations were made, including one from Brunei.* Mr. Casey did not tell the committee in November that funds from the arms sale had been diverted to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, although at the time he had information indicating such diversion.At a news conference, Senator Boren said the committee had ''no direct evidence that would state the President knew of the diversion of funds or directed the diversion of funds.'' Pro-Iranian BroadcastsThe report cites evidence that Mr. Reagan, with the advice and support of Mr. Casey, approved the shipment of missile parts to Iran last summer. This shows greater involvement by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Casey than had been suggested previously. According to the report, the White House, saying it was submitting a request from ''the highest levels,'' persuaded the Voice of America last fall to broadcast three editorials favorable to Iran.Senator Boren said one of the main remaining questions was ''the role private individuals may have played in the implementation of foreign policy.''The committee found, for example, that Albert Hakim, an American businessman who was born in Iran, helped open a new channel of communication to Iranian officials. Mr. Hakim also suggested in early 1986, it said, that Iranians should pay inflated prices for the arms so the profits could be given to the Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Hakim also helped raise private money in Europe for the rebels.In another instance, based on information the committee said it could not verify, Mr. Hakim's business partner, General Secord, and two former C.I.A. officials, Thomas Clines and Theodore G. Shackley, ''opened and/or controlled'' a Swiss bank account into which some profits from the arms sales were deposited.Money was apparently transferred from the Swiss accounts to accounts in the Grand Cayman Islands for eventual delivery to the rebels.The committee was not able to determine whether the rebels ever received any money from the arms deals. 'Almost Co-Equal' to NorthThe report quotes an unidentified C.I.A. officer as describing General Secord and Mr. Hakim as ''almost co-equal lieutenants'' of Colonel North. General Secord refused to testify before the committee on Fifth Amendment grounds, and Mr. Hakim could not be located.The report provides details about the activities of Mr. Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State. He told the committee how he had money for the rebels deposited in a Swiss account under the control of General Secord and other private citizens, even though the C.I.A. had provided Mr. Abrams with an account that could have been monitored by the Government. The money he deposited has disappeared.Mr. Boren said the committee had been unable to determine how much money was raised from the arms sales or how the money was spent. But the report contained indications that the arms were vastly overpriced and that some of the money was paid to arms dealers and to an Israeli official.A C.I.A. memorandum received by the panel raised the possibility that Amiran Nir, adviser to Shimon Peres when Mr. Peres was Prime Minister of Israel, had received $2 million in 1986 for an unspecified purpose.The report raises questions about some of the legal advice provided by Attorney General Meese. It says he advised officials the President could approve secret operations orally rather than in writing, as most lawmakers believe intelligence laws require. White House Issues StatementIn a statement today, David M. Abshire, Mr. Reagan's counselor on the Iran affair, said the White House was pleased with the decision to make the report public.''The President has consistently urged the release by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of this report on the Iran matter and the alleged diversion of funds to the anti-Sandinista forces and is pleased that this has now occurred,'' the statement said.''The committee's report is an important step toward getting to the bottom of this matter, as the President has promised. Toward this end, the President will continue to work with the select committees in Congress, the Tower board and the independent counsel.''The White House had been pressing for release in the expectation that the report would show Mr. Reagan was unaware of the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels. White House officials have also voiced the belief that release of the report would reduce public interest in the affair. Senators at News ConferenceAt a news conference, Senator Boren and Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, declined to draw conclusions from the findings. But Senator Boren said the report showed ''serious problems in the way foreign policy is made.''''The President should have had the benefit of those with expertise in the field,'' he said, adding that the State Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Central Intelligence Agency were often unaware of the activities of the White House staff.Senator Cohen said he saw ''serious deficiencies'' in Mr. Casey's testimony. This may have happened, the Senator said, because Mr. Casey was not fully informed or because he was ill. Shortly after his testimony before the intelligence panel, Mr. Casey underwent surgery for a malignant brain tumor.",9360934,9361359,9361201,9360995,9360836,9360933,9361204,9360868,9361203,9360846

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,FILM: WOODY ALLEN'S FOND REMEMBRANCES OF 'RADIO DAYS',"LEAD: RADIOS once came in two basic models of wooden cabinets. The table-top, sheathed in oak or mahogany veneer, looked like a small, peak-roofed sentry box, with Romanesque or Gothic arches in front of the sometimes gold-flecked fabric masking the speaker.RADIOS once came in two basic models of wooden cabinets. The table-top, sheathed in oak or mahogany veneer, looked like a small, peak-roofed sentry box, with Romanesque or Gothic arches in front of the sometimes gold-flecked fabric masking the speaker.The table-top radio added a certain tone to any suite of living-room furniture, though certainly not as much as the majestic console, the big, heavy floor-model that was a prized piece of furniture in its own right.For most of us who were born before World War II - or even during the war's early days - it's sometimes difficult to realize that these extraordinary objects are now antiques, and that the material that poured from their speakers constituted a singular, if short-lived, popular art. We didn't have to look at the radio -though we always did - to be swept up by the voice of the unknown diva on ''The Major Bowes Amateur Hour,'' the awful dooms facing ''Little Orphan Annie,'' the arcane knowledge possessed by contestants on ''Name That Tune,'' the adventures of ''The Lone Ranger,'' or the gaiety of the annual New Year's Eve festivities at the Roosevelt Hotel, presided over by Guy Lombardo. We didn't see a wooden cabinet, often scratched and scuffed, its speaker-fabric punctured by children who'd wanted to discover what was going on inside.Instead we saw a limitless universe, created entirely out of voices, music and sound effects that liberated each mind in direct relation to the quality of its imagination. When Uncle Bob (or Ted or Ray) promised to send a shooting star over the house to mark a young listener's birthday, the young listener, who had hung out the window for an hour without seeing the star, questioned not Uncle Bob (or Ted or Ray), but his own eyesight.What's sometimes referred to as the golden age of radio - roughly from the mid-30's through the mid-40's - holds a privileged position in the memories of most of us who grew up with it. Radio wasn't outside our lives. It coincided with - and helped to shape - our childhood and adolescence. As we slogged toward maturity, it also grew up and turned into television, leaving behind, like dead skin, transistorized talk-radio and nonstop music shows.It's this brief and, in hindsight, enchanted period that Woody Allen remembers in his most buoyant, comic and poignantly expressed of memoirs, titled, with his unflagging, poetic exactitude, ''Radio Days.''''Radio Days,'' which opens today at the New York Twin and other theaters, is as free in form as it is generous of spirit. It's a chronicle of a family during the radio years, as well as a series of short-short stories. These follow, one after another, like the tales of Scheherazade, if Scheherazade had been a red-headed little Jewish boy in the Rockaways, born poor, star-struck, infinitely curious, and seriously incompetent as a juvenile criminal.The little boy, Joe (Seth Green), whose recollected thoughts are spoken on the soundtrack by Mr. Allen, is so happily lost in the world of radio that he scarcely notices the Depression around him. He has ''Breakfast With Irene and Roger,'' who hobnob with the rich and famous (and talk about it the next morning), and he knows the true, inside story of Sally White (Mia Farrow), of ''Sally White and Her Great White Way,'' who's radio's most glamorous Broadway gossip columnist. He enjoys the intense arguments about the stars: ''He's a ventriloquist on radio. How do you know he doesn't move his lips?''The boy's first loyalty is to the Masked Avenger (Wallace Shawn), a Green Hornet-sort of radio vigilante who, at the moment of triumph, says heartily, ''It's off to jail for you! I hope you enjoy making license plates!''To buy the Masked Avenger's ''secret-compartment ring,'' Joe helps himself to donations intended for the ''Jewish Homeland Fund.'' This leads to a good deal of physical stress in a confrontation with his parents and his rabbi, who compete with each other for the right of beating the boy senseless (in the middle of which Joe solemnly addresses the rabbi as ''My faithful Indian companion'').Joe is, indeed, surrounded by stress and aggravation, from morning to night. ''Turn off the radio,'' screams his mother (Julie Kavner). ''Why should I?'' says the boy. ''You listen to it.'' ''That's different,'' she says. ''Our lives are ruined anyway.'' Radio is Joe's Camelot.  Never has Mr. Allen been so steadily in control, as ''Radio Days'' slides from low blackout sketch to high satire to family drama that's as funny as it is moving.One of the film's many performances-without-price is Dianne Wiest's as Joe's ever-hopeful, unmarried Aunt Bea, who's attracted to the wrong men mostly because they're the only ones available. On a foggy night, while parked at Breezy Point, a particularly promising suitor hysterically abandons Bea when he hears the news that the Martians have landed in New Jersey.''Radio Days'' is so densely packed with vivid detail of place, time, music, event and character that it's virtually impossible to take them all in in one sitting. Carlo Di Palma is again responsible for the stunning photography, and Santo Loquasto for the production design.Among the memorable presences who fill the screen there are old Mrs. Silverman, who has a fatal heart attack - her teacup halfway to her lips - after watching a white woman kiss a black man, and gentle Mr. Zipsky who, without warning, has a breakdown and takes a meat cleaver to his neighbors. Also: genial Uncle Abe (Josh Mostel), who goes next door to complain to the radical neighbors, playing their radio on the high holy days, and returns several hours later as a confirmed Marxist.The members of the huge cast are uniformly splendid. Many, like Tony Roberts, Danny Aiello and Jeff Daniels, are familiar from earlier Allen films, while others, like David Warrilow and Tito Puente, are new.The film is nothing if not generous with - and to - its talent. Miss Farrow is hilariously common-sensical as the ambitious cigarette girl (''Who is Pearl Harbor?'' she asks in bewilderment on Dec. 7, 1941), and Diane Keaton, on the screen only a few minutes, helps to bring the film to its magical conclusion with a lovely, absolutely straight rendition of ''You'd Be So Nice to Come Home to.'' It's New Year's Eve, 1943, and Mr. Allen's radio days are as numbered as those of Proust's old Prince de Guermantes.''Those voices,'' says the narrator by way of a benediction, ''grow dimmer and dimmer.''At this point I can't think of any film maker of Mr. Allen's generation with whom he can be compared, certainly no one at work in American movies today. As the writer, director and star (even when he doesn't actually appear) of his films, Mr. Allen works more like a novelist who's able to pursue his own obsessions, fantasies and concerns without improvements imposed on him by committees.At this point, too, his films can be seen as part of a rare continuum. Each of us has his favorite Allen movie, but to cite one over another as ''more important,'' ''bigger,'' ''smaller'' or ''less significant'' is to miss the joys of the entire body of work that is now taking shape. ''Radio Days'' is a joyful addition.Mr. Allen, our most prodigal cinema resource, moves on.''Radio Days,'' which has been rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''), includes some mildly vulgar language and double-entendres.

At that time, the Iranian leader said the United States had sent the Bible and a cake shaped like a key, reportedly in an allusion to the possible opening of relations.The Iranian leader spoke after a Beirut magazine had revealed the secret sale of arms to Iran by reporting a trip to Teheran by Robert C. McFarlane, former national security adviser.After the disclosure, Mr. Reagan said on television on Nov. 13, ''Don't believe all these wild stories.''Today Mr. Speakes said the handwritten passage in the Bible, from Galatians, had been suggested to Mr. Reagan by Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser.The White House spokesman said details about the Bible had been uncovered in a review of documents left by Admiral Poindexter and his aide, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. Mr. Speakes said that Colonel North was almost certainly the emissary at the Frankfurt meeting, which occurred a few days after Mr. Reagan had signed the Bible. Mr. Speakes said he did not know the identity of the Iranian intermediary.According to Mr. Speakes, the sending of a signed Bible had been suggested by Colonel North ''because there had been discussions about the common religious heritage that existed between Moslem and Christian and Jewish religions.''The handwritten quotation read: ''And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, 'All the nations shall be blessed in you.' Galatians 3:8. Ronald Reagan. Oct 3, 1986.''When Mr. Speakes was asked why he had not acknowledged the Bible episode in the first place, he said the White House wanted to be sure of its facts.",9360934,9360836,9360933,9360848,9360846

The court, in a hearing by telephone, voted 5 to 2. to reject lawyers' pleas for a stay.The convict, Ramon Hernandez, 44 years old, of El Paso, was pronounced dead at 1:13 A.M. after an injection, said Attorney General Jim Mattox. He was the 21st Texas inmate to be executed since the state resumed the death penalty in 1982.Earlier Thursday, a state judge and two Federal courts declined to stay the execution. A state prosecutor said Mr. Hernandez declined help in a telephone conversation with Judge Peter Peca of State District Court.''The court asked if he wanted a stay and asked what he wanted and he apparently refused to do anything,'' Bill Zapalac, an Assistant Attorney General, said. ''The trial court recommended that relief be denied.''Anyone can file on behalf of an inmate, ''but if the inmate refuses to have it considered, the court doesn't have to consider it,'' said Mr. Zapalac.Richard Lovelace, who defended Mr. Hernandez at his trial, filed the request for a stay of execution, but Mr. Zapalac said Mr. Hernandez would not accept Mr. Lovelace as his attorney.After speaking with Judge Peca, Mr. Hernandez was moved from his Death Row cell to a holding cell next to the death chamber while lawyers pressed appeals before Federal District Judge Lucius Bunton and the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in New Orleans.''Nobody wants to die,'' Mr. Hernandez said in an interview this week. ''But sometimes people have to make a stand. I have a paramount right to represent myself.Mr. Hernandez was convicted of killing Oscar Frayre in a 3 A.M. burglary at an El Paso service station on June 20, 1980.Mr. Frayre was asleep at the closed service station when he was shot.",9361200

REPORTS IT LOST $1.17 BILLION IN QUARTER,"LEAD: The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it lost $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter because of a $3.2 billion charge taken to reduce its work force and consolidate operations.The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it lost $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter because of a $3.2 billion charge taken to reduce its work force and consolidate operations.The quarterly loss, though expected, was the largest posted by A.T.&T. since it agreed to divest itself of the regional telephone operating companies in 1984.A.T.&T. finished the year with a small profit, however. Net income for the year was $139 million, or 5 cents a share, down 91.1 percent from $1.56 billion, or $1.37 a share, in 1985.Last month, A.T.&T. announced that it would elminate 27,400 jobs and take the $3.2 billion charge to cover early retirement and severance costs, write-downs in the value of some assets and the expenses for consolidating operations.Most of the charges were taken in the fourth quarter. In the comparable 1985 quarter, A.T.&T. earned $364 million, or 32 cents a share. Fourth-quarter revenues decreased 4.1 percent, to $8.53 billion, from $8.89 billion last year. ''Our earnings from operations were essentially flat; our costs too high, and our results mixed,'' James E. Olson, A.T.&T.'s chairman, said in a statement. ''We are taking decisive actions to strengthen our core businesses by eliminating costs,'' but ''it will take some time to digest these changes.''Last year A.T.&T. suffered a decline in income from equipment rentals and a leveling-off in sales of equipment to other telephone companies.Revenues for the year dipped 1 percent, to $34.09 billion, from $34.42 billion in 1985. Costs and expenses rose 7.4 percent for the year and 33.8 percent for the fourth quarter.A.T.&T. has also sustained heavy losses from its efforts to establish itself in computers and information processing. Analysts estimate that the company's Information Systems Group lost about $800 million last year. Bell AtlanticThe Bell Atlantic Corporation, the Phildelphia-based regional telephone company, said yesterday that its earnings in the fourth quarter rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $271.9 million, or $1.37 a share, from $269.7 million, or $1.34 a share, last year. Revenue rose 11.9 percent, to $2.60 billion, from $2.33 billion a year earlier. For all of 1986, earnings were up 7 percent, to $1.17 billion, or $5.85 a share, from $1.09 billion, or $5.47 a share in 1985.",9361050,9360840,9361051

Fifteen family shelters would hold 100 families each, and five dormitory-style shelters with 200 beds each would provide housing for 1,000 adults. Family-Oriented ClustersThe mayoral plan has been criticized by all five borough presidents, who favor housing rehabilitation efforts or, in the case of Queens, smaller, family-oriented clusters dispersed throughout the borough.But pressure from the Koch administration on the borough presidents has, except in the case of Staten Island, resulted in detailed alternative plans for dealing with the homeless problem.The Queens proposals have won the interest of the Koch administration, which indicated yesterday that it was prepared to hold discussions on the basis of the 13 sites that have been proposed there for clusters of 25 families each. However, Stella Schindler, the Mayor's director for the homeless and single-room-occupancy housing services, said 25 families per site was far too low and would not be cost-effective.But she said the proposals were ''very interesting'' and something that ''we would be prepared to talk about'' once the list of sites was provided. Preparing List of SitesA spokesman for Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, Sam Samuels, said the borough was preparing a list of available sites that should be ready ''within a week or so.'' He said he was encouraged by the positive response from the Koch administration to the proposals.Marilyn Gelber, a spokesman for Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn, said borough officials were still working on a detailed report and would not comment now. She indicated, however, that Brooklyn favored a long-term approach based on rehabilitation of older housing.The Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, has also advocated a large-scale rehabilitation plan. Manhattan currently houses about 50 percent of the city's homeless population. 'Never Shirked' ResponsibilityMr. Simon stressed yesterday that he was not seeking a confrontation with the Mayor. ''In the Bronx, we have never shirked our responsibility in meeting the needs of the homeless,'' he said.The new sites proposed by Mr. Simon's committee are one between 141st and 142d Streets and bordered by Jackson and Powers Avenues in the South Bronx and another for a shelter for women on Tillotson Avenue off Baychester Avenue in the North Bronx.After making a strong plea for consideration to be given to the rehabilitation of more than 1,000 vacant buildings in the Bronx, Mr. Simon said that if the Mayor rejected his plan for rehabilitation, he ''would be prepared to sit down with him and discuss two additional and more appropriate sites.''Miss Schindler said that housing rehabilitation programs would continue but that they were no substitute for emergency housing.",9361085

He was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.Dr. Nathan, who was born July 15, 1893, in Bigen, Germany, was an economic adviser to the Weimar Republic from 1920 to 1933. He served as a German delegate to the World Economic Conference in Geneva in 1927.With the rise of Hitler to power, Dr. Nathan fled to the United States, where he joined the faculty of Princeton University in the economics department. It was at Princeton that he began his friendship with Dr. Einstein.Dr. Nathan was the sole executor of Dr. Einstein's estate after the scientist's death in 1955 and was co-trustee of his literary property along with Dr. Einstein's secretary, Helen Dukas, who died in 1982.In the last three decades of his life, Dr. Nathan's primary interest was the Einstein archive, which he trebled in size. The archive was turned over to the Hebrew University of Israel in 1982.Dr. Nathan, who earned doctorates in economics and law at Freiburg and Munich Universities, taught economics at Princeton, New York University, Howard University and Vassar College. He also served as a consultant on economic literature to the Library of Congress.In the mid-1950's, Dr. Nathan had difficulty obtaining a passport and later became a target of the House Un-American Activities Committee.He declined to answer questions from the committee, saying he believed that ''no Congressional committee has the right to inquire into the political beliefs of American citizens.''In 1955, he forced the State Department, by court action, to grant him a passport after he swore that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. And in 1957, he won an acquittal on a contempt of Congress charge stemming from the confrontation with the House committee.Dr. Nathan was the author of numerous books, including ''The Nazi Economic System: Germany's Mobilization for War,'' and ''Nazi War Finance and Banking,'' both in 1944. He also helped Heinz Horden write ''Einstein on Peace'' in 1961.Dr. Nathan, who became a naturalized citizen in 1939, is survived by a niece, Doris Nathan, of Manhattan."

That was the least of it. ''I also have a list of all the recreation places in the county,'' he said. ''Do you heat your home by oil?'' (He had tips on low-price fuel). ''Do you commute to New York City? Do you need a car pool? How about a list of low-interest credit cards?''''This is quite a service,'' said the woman, who seemed a bit shocked by all the problems Mr. Feiner could solve.Since being elected three years ago, Mr. Feiner, a Democrat, has faithfully set up his problem-solving card table three times a week at the local A.&P., Grand Union and Shopwell stores. In his quest to be the most accessible politician in America, he recently announced a plan to make house calls to solve residents' problems. He encourages people to call him on his home telephone, which is listed. ''Call me up to midnight,'' he told Bethann Maple. He is helping her find an apartment.''Let's say 20 years from now I get all the breaks and I'm a U.S. Senator,'' Mr. Feiner said in a rare break from problem-solving. ''I'll still be in supermarkets every week. If Grand Union said to me, 'You can't be inside,' I'd be outside every week, even if it was 1 degree out.''Mr. Feiner is only 30 years old, but already he is known as a longtime activist. In the ninth grade he joined his first volunteer board; at 20 he played a key role in opening a Scarsdale political club to women, and at 25, after fighting for better public transportation, he ran his own bus service out of his parents' home.For most, the $24,000 county legislator's post is a part-time job. Mr. Feiner treats it as if it were six or seven jobs.When he was elected, he stopped practicing law. ''Last year at timesI was the only one in the county office building,'' he said. ''Two years ago I came in on Christmas day - of course, I am Jewish.''Four times a year he mails progress reports to constituents. After his latest, Irene Arfer wrote, ''I have just read your fourth quarterly report and I am practically in tears.'' Many of the problems he solves are poor people's.He drives a 1981 Chevette that has a big ''Problem-Solver'' sign on the roof. The Fairview Community Center is a regular stop. Barbara Perry, a staffer, said many there do not realize he is a legislator. ''They say is that man coming today, the one who helps people?'' she said.Last year, when Clementine Chain, 78, was being evicted because she could not pay a rent increase, Mr. Feiner said he would pay the increase and started the Have a Heart for the Homeless fund. ''We've helped 10 families so far,'' he said. ''We saved a man on a respirator from being evicted.''When he first took office, Mr. Feiner used the county copying machine so much that the chairman of the Board of Legislators, Edward Brady, a Republican, took away Mr. Feiner's copying privileges. ''He did nothing but run that Xerox machine,'' Mr. Brady said.''I do a lot of special projects,'' said Mr. Feiner, who won his copying rights back.Political foes such as Mr. Brady say Mr. Feiner is ''short on substance'' and so busy with little problems that he ignores complex matters.Mr. Feiner answers that he is a Democrat in a Republican-controlled Legislature. ''Let's say I propose all these laws - a lot don't go anywhere. If I can't solve all their problems by legislation, at least I can help people.''I'm doing about 5,000 problems a year now. I read in the Congressional Quarterly that's what a Congressman does, so that's pretty good. I don't have any paid staff.''He remedied his problem of a staff in about 10 seconds by setting up a volunteer student internship program. As many as 15 people at a time have worked for Mr. Feiner.''There's always an army of his interns at that Xerox machine,'' said Mr. Brady.But even Mr. Brady cannot get too upset with Mr. Feiner. Last year when Mr. Brady's nephew needed money for an organ transplant, Mr. Feiner took part in a Bike-a-thon, riding 187 miles in two days and raising $1,000 for Mr. Brady's nephew. ''Yes,'' said Mr. Brady. ''I like him.'' Mr. Feiner works so much, people wonder how he would be able to keep it up if he were married with children. ''The main thing for me is to make sure the woman I marry understands my career,'' he said. ''I guess I have to be more careful than most people.''He said he feels as optimistic about government at 30 as he did at 20. ''I feel things are progressing,'' he said.Wednesday night it was after 10 o'clock when he returned home to his studio apartment here. There were six calls on the answering machine. A man needed help fighting a development in Mount Pleasant. A woman needed a hiking map. Someone was angry because a bus did not show up.COLUMN ONE: OUR TOWNS",9360836,9360961

You called his proposal ''cornball populist politics'' and proposed an energy tax instead. Now, a former Reagan Administration official, Paul Craig Roberts (Op-Ed, Jan. 16), repeats your suggestion that the proposal is primarily political. He also shows us a route by which the Reagan Administration and its acolytes intend to weasel out of responsibility for the enormous deficits of the last five years. ''Politicians can no longer credibly blame tax cuts for the consequences of monetary policy,'' he writes. So Paul A. Volcker caused all those deficits.Various remedies will be required to reduce the Federal deficit, and a tax increase will have to be among them. Since income tax on individuals accounts for roughly two-thirds of Federal revenues (if one excludes social insurance receipts and borrowing), it must almost certainly provide a portion of an increase in revenues. Representative Wright's proposal recognizes this reality. To suggest, as you did, that it would be a broken promise for Congress to raise the income tax brackets, is nonsense.Everyone knows that this country cannot continue to have $200 billion deficits every year. President Reagan and most of the Republican Party leadership have failed to respond responsibly to the problem. The Speaker of the House has, and for it he deserves our gratitude and our support.

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,FOUNDATION OPENS $25 MILLION DRIVE ON SCIENCE EDUCATION,"LEAD: The National Science Foundation today opened a $25 million campaign to improve science education in elementary and secondary schools in the agency's largest such effort since the 1960's.The National Science Foundation today opened a $25 million campaign to improve science education in elementary and secondary schools in the agency's largest such effort since the 1960's.In its first action under the program, the foundation awarded $6.6 million in grants to three research centers that will work with three publishers and selected schools to develop new teaching materials for science instruction for children in kindergarten through sixth grade.''We are failing to provide an adequate background, an adequate introduction and an adequate level of science literacy for the population as a whole,'' Bassam Shakhashiri, a foundation official, said in announcing the campaign. ''As a result, the preparation of a sufficient number of candidates for careers in science, engineering and technology is inadequate.'' Early Focus on Younger PupilsUnder the program, the foundation, an independent Federal agency, will award $25 million in grants over the next 10 years to private research centers to develop new science curriculums and materials. Publishers chosen to work with the researchers will be required to match the Federal grants.Mr. Shakhashiri, the foundation's assistant director for science and engineering education, said the project would at first focus on elementary school students because most of them received little science education, if any. He said science materials for junior high and high school students would be developed at a later stage.He said a major reason for the project was that the nation needed a ''technically sophisticated work force'' to remain economically competitive.George Tressel, division director of materials development for the foundation, said the new curriculums would involve actual experience whenever possible and would seek to develop a general understanding of scientific principles and methods.By contrast, he said, in the 1960's when the nation faced a Soviet challenge after the launching of the first space satellite, the foundation sought to foster the development of model curriculums for developing scientists.''This time we're focusing on little people, not little scientists, although we hope some of them will turn into little scientists,'' Mr. Tressel said.The average time now devoted to science in elementary grades is less than one and a quarter hours a week, Mr. Tressel said.Mr. Shakhashiri said he expected the materials produced by the first recipients to be available for purchase by schools within four years.Among the grants announced today was a $2.2 million award to the Technical Education Research Centers of Cambridge, Mass., which will work with the National Geographic Society to develop 10 science units for grades four through six and a telecommunications system linked to classrooms. About 4,000 schools will participate in gathering and sharing data on current topics through computer systems. The society will contribute at least $2.5 million and publish course materials.The second grant, to Biological Science Curriculum Study of Colorado Springs, provides $2.3 million for development of science and health curriculums in elementary schools. The materials will include teacher guides, computer software and activities integrating science with other subjects.Classes in Colorado Springs will participate and the Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company of Dubuque, Iowa, will contribute $2.9 million and publish course materials.The third grant, $2.1 million to the Education Development Center of Newton, Mass., will go toward developing a life, physical and earth science curriculum for urban schools.",9361080

This will put an end to all the human-interest stories about heroic commuters managing to get to work against all obstacles. But since Congress has mandated another cooling-off period with at least the possibility that the strike could resume after 60 days or so, we would still like to see some articles addressing the following questions:* Did railroad management and labor waste two years in negotiations because they knew they could achieve their ends by provoking a strike?* Was the final 120-day cooling-off period called for in October because management feared that a strike might embarrass incumbent politicians just before elections, or because labor felt that the inclement weather likely to occur in January would further inconvenience commuters and thereby cause a public outcry for settlement at any cost?* Was the Railway Act designed to aid the negotiation process or to allow for years of procrastination in lieu of negotiation?* Why doesn't the Railway Act provide for binding arbitration after all other measures have been exhausted, instead of allowing a strike?* Why is labor's right to strike blindly accepted, while the public's right to services paid for by tax dollars and the sale of expensive commutation tickets is ignored?* Should we conceive of this matter solely as a management-labor dispute or ask whether the petty bickerings of a few thousand disgruntled workers and an indifferent management should be allowed to disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of commuters and adversely affect thousands of businesses?We accept that railroad employees deserve fair compensation for their labors, and we understand that management must hold costs down in an era of fiscal restraint. We reject, however, the belief that the public may be used in labor negotiations as bargaining chips or hostages. We would also point out that management's plans for alternative transportation during the strike were pathetically inadequate, given that negotiations have dragged on for two years.We wonder if our own civil rights have been violated as a result of this mess.

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,WHO'S AFRAID OF THE NEW BRITISH READING ROOM?,"LEAD: As long as there's an England, there will probably be a reading room at the British Museum.As long as there's an England, there will probably be a reading room at the British Museum.But there is a keen and continuing dispute among Britons about exactly how best to use the splendid high-domed room, which was a workplace for, among others, Karl Marx, Charles Dickens, George Bernard Shaw and Lenin, who signed in as Jacob Richter LL.D.The disagreement, which divides titled notables as well as untitled librarians and bureaucrats, centers on the reorganization of the British Library and its new building. One side feels it is about to be kicked out of its traditional reading place; the other side says their opponents should be happy they are getting a new place with a better atmosphere for books, if not readers.First, the combatants master the complicated history and logistics of the Reading Room Question, a feat compared to Viscount Palmerston's statement that only three men ever understood the Schleswig-Holstein Question: ''One died, one went mad, and I've forgotten.'' The Battle ContinuesThe reading room battle continues, in statements and counterstatements and newspaper articles and readers' letters, because the Government has not given final approval to the part of the plan that is most controversial. But the Government could act at any time, as no further approval by Parliament is needed.The Government is not saying what it will do, and many of the antagonists consider themselves friends of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.In 1973, the reorganization took control of the reading room away from the British Museum and gave it to a new body, the British Library. The British Library then began to construct a huge, new building for itself, about a mile away from the museum, which is in Bloomsbury.Under the library's plan, its new building, adjacent to St. Pancras Station, is to have a reading room that takes over the functions of the old one back at the British Museum. The collection of rare books and papers now only available in the old reading room are to be available only in the new reading room. For Special CollectionsThe reading room at the museum would be used for special collections of the museum. But the trove of works in the arts and humanities, as the property of the library, would no longer be available under the famous light-blue dome, whose 140-foot diameter is slightly greater than that of St. Peter's Basilica.The chairman of the British Library, and chief proponent of moving books to the new reading room, is Anthony Meredith Quinton, a philosopher who is the President of Trinity College, Oxford.The opponents are headed by his friend, Hugh Thomas, the historian. They both note that Lord Quinton was once a member of the Campaign to Save the Round Reading Room. ''An embarrassment,'' Lord Quinton said in an interview.Both said they were friendly with Daniel J. Boorstin, the Librarian of Congress, and had discussed the dome controversy with him. Lord Quinton said he had the impression that Dr. Boorstin tended to agree with him that the solution was definitely not an underground railroad to circulate the rare books between the new building and the old room. 'A Loyal Bodleian Man'The railroad was Lord Thomas's idea. Such a railway was not successful, Lord Quinton said, in serving readers at the Bodleian Library at Oxford.''I've never been a great one for the reading room,'' he said of the one at museum, with its special collections in history and social sciences. ''As a philosopher, I've stayed at Oxford. I've been a loyal Bodleian man.'' He added of the London room: ''It's a remarkable piece of Victorian architecture. One feels one is in a holy place.''Of the shape of the new building, designed by Colin St. John Wilson, he said, agreeing with opponents that ''it is fair to say that it came at the tail end of a certain architectural style that is now much blown upon.'' Macaulay on Architecture''It is very stark,'' he said. ''But Macaulay said, 'In architecture mere bulk is an element of sublimity.' It certainly isn't going to be pretty.''Then he summarized the argument of the proponents of taking the old books away from the old reading room, saying of the new building, ''It will be an efficient container of books.''Lord Quinton said the first books would start to be moved into the new building and made available there in two or three years, once the building is finished. He said he thought Lord Thomas might be ready to compromise because he had already achieved two of three goals: preserving the architecture of the old domed reading room, and preserving the structure as a reading room, albeit a different kind of reading room. The compromise might be to stop fighting the absorption of old room's books by the new room in the new building.The manager of the building project for the British Library, David Rodger, said he sometimes grew weary of Lord Thomas's campaign. ''His proposal is based on flimsy priorities. We're not prepared to let rare books be moved by rail or by tunnel.'' Every Book in the CountryMr. Rodger said the collection of British Library, which by law must have a copy of every book, newspaper and journal published in the country, was 15.5 million volumes and was growing at the rate of about 4.3 miles a year, standing up in shelf stacks.He said the Government had already approved a new reading room with 413 seats in the new building, to hold the library collections on music and fine arts, and had authorized the transfer of books from the old museum reading room.But, partly as a result of the Thomas campaign, there is still no authorization to move the humanities collection and to provide 300 additional seats for readers of that collection. Mr. Rodger agreed that Lord Thomas had won important victories.Lord Thomas, who has used the reading room since 1958 - when he researched ''The Spanish Civil War'' - was adamant, but not rigid. ''We feel it's a marvelous library, a great room, inspiring to work in. It's not overcrowded, as it was in the early 70's when there so many American research students you couldn't get a seat.''

But he said this was done only on a limited basis and at selected airports.Still, the Air Transport Association, which represents major scheduled airlines and proposed last year that the practice of in-flight holding be resumed, took issue with the Administrator's position and rationale.''F.A.A. data show that considerable holding is being used in day-to-day operations at a number of major airports, always consistent with safety,'' said Daniel Z. Henkin, the association's senior vice president for public information.

Baker Jr. has a splendid view of Pennsylvania Avenue, the route of Presidential inaugural parades. Mr. Baker is still trying to decide whether he would rather be leading that parade in 1988 or watching it from his eighth-floor window.Although he consistently runs third in most public opinion polls, behind Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Mr. Baker, the former Senate majority leader, who is concerned about his wife's health, has delayed his decision on whether to seek the Republican nomination for President so many times that some of his supporters in key states have begun to drift away.First, he promised to decide after the 1986 elections. Then the date was moved back to the end of the year. It was pushed back again to Feb. 1, and now he says he will announce his plans soon, ''sometime within the next few weeks.'' Hard to Hold People 'in Place'The situation is especially critical in New Hampshire, a state that figures heavily into any Baker strategy. Were he to run, Mr. Baker, a Tennessean, has said he would compete in the Iowa caucuses, strive for a breakthrough in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary, and then carry his campaign to the South, where a dozen or so states will hold primaries on March 8, 1988, in one of the main events of the nomination contest.''It's hard to tell people to hold in place when you are unable to give them some manifestation of a candidacy,'' said one Baker strategist in New Hampshire, where an increasing number of his supporters are showing an interest in Mr. Dole, Mr. Baker's successor as the Republican leader of the Senate. ''Dole was up here last week and did 16 events in three days, and I'm getting calls from people saying, 'What's your guy going to do?' ''Another Baker strategist said: ''Although most of them haven't announced, the others are perceived as candidates but Howard is not and won't be until he makes up his mind.''In an interview, Mr. Baker acknowledged that some of his supporters had begun ''to get nervous,'' adding, ''You got to expect some of that and I'm not put off by any defections. Certainly that's a risk you take but I'm convinced the support is out there to be got.'' Rudman Believes There's TimeSenator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, one of Mr. Baker's closest advisers, acknowledged that the delays had not made Mr. Baker's task any easier, but he insists that there is still time to organize an effective campaign.''A lot of things are involved in the New Hampshire primary,'' he said. ''One is organization, and that could suffer. But there is also the questions of candidate appeal and how the opposition is doing, and these two things have less to do with the timing of a campaign.''Mr. Baker is not being coy about his plans. In assessing the Republican field, he says, ''I'm convinced this race is wide open.'' Although Mr. Bush is the clear front-runner, Mr. Baker said it was too early to know how damaged the Vice President had been by the controversy over arms sales to Iran. ''I don't think Bush is unstoppable,'' he said. He Speaks of His RivalsMr. Dole, he said, has done ''an exceptional job'' of establishing early strength, ''but it's still early.'' And Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, Mr. Baker said, ''has not done as well as I thought he would in galvanizing the very conservative wing of the party.''So what is holding him back? His main concern is not the political odds against him but the health of his wife, Joy. She underwent surgery for lung cancer more than four years ago and there has been no recurrence. She also had intestinal surgery last year and suffers from a back problem that her doctors have not yet been able to diagnose.''My question is whether she is well enough for me to be gone for long periods of time,'' he said. ''The preliminary answer is yes, but I monitor that carefully every day.''If he decides to forgo a Presidential bid, his friends say, Mr. Baker, who is 61 years old, is likely to cite reasons other than his wife's health. He is determined, they said, that she not feel that his devotion to her deprived him of what could be his last opportunity to seek the Presidency. He Rejects Such a PositionThe former Senator put it this way: ''I'm not going to be put in a position where I have to make a choice between responsibility to her and running for President.''One way out of the dilemma, some of his associates say, would be for Mr. Baker to be offered the job of Secretary of State if George P. Schultz should resign, although no one thinks that is likely any time soon and certainly not before Mr. Baker has to make up his mind about running.''Howard has made it clear that he would be interested in being Secretary of State in the last two years of the Reagan Administration,'' said one friend. ''He feels like he could get an arms agreement with the Soviets and he would be willing to sacrifice his ambition to be President and the money he is making to have that chance.''Asked if he expected to wind up in the Reagan Administration, Mr. Baker said, ''Not really.'' But he added, ''I'd consider anything if the President said point-blank that he wanted me to do it in the interest of our country.'' Offer on Casey JobPresident Reagan apparently did not phrase it that way when he recently asked Mr. Baker to replace William J. Casey, who is recovering from surgery on a brain tumor, as Director of Central Intelligence. Mr. Baker is clearly miffed about some news accounts of his conversation with Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, over that job offer, which he turned down.He said he did not, as reported, tell Mr. Regan that he would take the job if Mr. Reagan called him directly and offered it to him. At a meeting in the Old Executive Office Building, Mr. Baker said, the chief of staff asked him to consider the intelligence job. ''I said, 'Don, I don't really want to do that, but I appreciate the offer and hope you will convey that to the President,' '' Mr. Baker recounted. ''Then I suggested some other names.''The next day, he said, he received a call from Mr. Reagan, who was at Camp David. Mr. Baker recalled their conversation: ''He told me, 'Howard, we thought we had us a Director of Central Intelligence, but Don tells me you don't really want to do that and I understand.' I told him I was glad he understood and then we talked about his dog, the snow and some other matters.''  WASHINGTON TALK",9360864,9360853,9360836,9360851,9360846,9360854

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,IRISH POLITICIAN TRIES FOR 3D COMEBACK,"LEAD: Charles J. Haughey, the frayed but durable ''Boss'' of Irish politics who descends on precincts in his bright green helicopter, today began his campaign to become Prime Minister a third time.Charles J. Haughey, the frayed but durable ''Boss'' of Irish politics who descends on precincts in his bright green helicopter, today began his campaign to become Prime Minister a third time.Mr. Haughey quickly showed his front-runner's status by being genial but unspecific about his promise to resurrect Ireland's crippled economy.Instead, he excoriated the fallen government of Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald and welcomed his opposition's challenge that Mr. Haughey has garnered little more than tattered credibility in having won the top post twice before yet being able to hold it only briefly. He was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1981 and for several months in 1982.''Credibility is it?'' said Mr. Haughey, 61 years old, the leader of the Fianna Fail Party who has spent 30 years in the rough and tumble of Irish politics.''I'm not going to take any lectures,'' he said before almost gleefully citing the dismal statistics of the FitzGerald Government's record deficits and budget borrowing and the nation's critical levels of taxation, unemployment and emigration. ''I just leave it to everybody to judge whose credibility is at stake.''As he unveiled the party platform for the Feb. 17 election at a hotel news conference, three rows of supporters behind Mr. Haughey, an enduring campaigner.Even his harshest critics concede that in Mr. Haughey, a man of youthful grayness with the politician's gift for shifting easily from a merry smile to a wary glance, there is the Lazarus touch of Richard M. Nixon for prevailing across decades in politics.Seventeen years ago, he was pronounced politically dead by the pundits after he was indicted on gun-running charges and had to resign from Government as a promising junior minister. He was acquitted and within minutes was beginning his comeback from the courthouse steps. With the sectarian troubles of Northern Ireland muted lately by the English-Irish agreement, Mr. Haughey today made no campaign promises to reject the treaty. Avoids Making PromisesHis two earlier incumbencies as Prime Minister were rooted in a wheel-horse persistence at protecting his base by showing a clubhouse leader's willingness to attend to requests for favors like so many soulful confessions. ''What about the rest of the country?'' became a famous cry in Parliament when a blatant bill of favors was granted to a lawmaker whose swing vote was wooed by a past Haughey coalition government.Today, Mr. Haughey, an accountant by profession, was making no specific promises to anyone. He even conceded that he had wheeled and dealed too compromisingly as a past coalition Prime Minister in search of the marginal vote.But the Government was far more compromised in the last four years of the coalition led by Dr. FitzGerald, Mr. Haughey contended today, while urging the voters to give his own party a clear majority in the 166-seat Parliament.A Haughey triumph is suggested lately in early opinion polls that show his party with 52 percent popular support and Dr. FitzGerald's Fine Gael Party down to 23 percent.Mr. Haughey's opening campaign riposte to Dr. FitzGerald, a more sedate and academic-styled politician, was to estimate that a Haughey victory would itself be the signal for renewed economic growth. The gross national product has been negative at times in recent years, and while the Central Bank estimates a modest turnabout this year to a 1.5 percent growth rate, Mr. Haughey talked of 2.5 percent.''The general election and its outcome could well be the trigger,'' he said, contending that he could lure back more than $2 billion in investment capital that he said had fled Ireland's high interest rates and taxes in the last four years. Unemployment at 19 percentUnemployment is at 250,000, or 19 percent; young, educated Irish are emigrating at the rate of 30,000 a year, and taxes are the highest in western Europe, with the rate of 58 percent on a single person earning $14,000 a year.Repeatedly, reporters at the news conference sought details of his solutions to these problems. But Mr. Haughey refused to echo the Draconian cuts in public spending that Dr. FitzGerald has reluctantly proposed; he talked in general terms of sparking growth and holding the budget deficit near last year's $1.9 billion. Government debt has doubled to $36 billion in the last four years.",9360836

Unfortunately, it is not so simple as Deng versus Deng. It is Deng Xiaoping and his reformist colleagues versus the entrenched party bureaucracy, a point well made by Rebecca Karl (letter, Jan. 16).Mr. Deng and his allies are aware of the need to adjust the political superstructure to the changing economic structure, and they appreciate that they need the support of intellectuals and students if China's four modernizations are to be realized. It is probable, also, that Mr. Deng, Zhao Ziyang, Hu Yaobang (now resigned) and company do not have a clear vision of what political structural reform may entail or what the proper future role of the party should be. Yet, they must resist an opposition that is against not only political reform but also many of the economic changes of recent years.In the short term, Mr. Deng has to get the party through its scheduled congress later this year without giving his opponents (Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, et.al.) the opening they need to throw out all that has been accomplished since the third plenum of the 11th Central Committee in 1979. In this politically delicate period preceding the congress, the last thing Mr. Deng needs is the intellectuals and students yapping at his heels by demanding reforms no Chinese leader could deliver, even if he wanted.Thus, it may be true, as you state, that ''maneuver alone cannot lastingly resolve the conflict,'' but lasting resolution simply may not be feasible. This leaves what Mr. Deng has done so successfully in the past: two steps forward, one step back. Surely, this is better than the three steps back that the opposition would prefer. GEORGE K.

Sam is the acronym for Screen Activated Machines, customer-operated electronic ticket dispensers, nine of which have been installed at Hialeah Park.Horse-players who place their bets with Sam this winter are not patronizing a local bookie, but getting a glimpse at the future of parimutuel wagering. Sam is the acronym for Screen Activated Machines, customer-operated electronic ticket dispensers, nine of which have been installed at Hialeah Park.Sam is fairly ingenious. A bettor inserts either a winning ticket or a voucher - which can be bought from regular parimutuel clerks - into the machine, which looks like a video game. The machine then asks him how much he wants to bet, and the numbers of the horses.The bettor touches numbers on the heat-sensitive screen to make his choices, and a display window in the corner shows him what his ticket will look like. Bets of even the highest complexity, such as trifecta part-wheels involving hundreds of combinations on a different ticket, can be made. When the bettor is happy with his choices, he touches another part of the screen, and the machine spews out his tickets and a voucher for any change.The machines are a bit slower than skilled parimutuel tellers, whose fingers can move faster over their keyboards than any bettor's can on the screen. One advantage to the machine is privacy, since no one can hear you calling your bets. Another is that by using the vouchers, you can buy in at the beginning of the day and cash out at the end without touching any grubby cash in between. That takes the thrill out of victory for some players, but others find it safer and more convenient.The machines are the first step in what industry analysts see as a computerized and cashless future of parimutuels. Bettors may eventually have personalized accounts and access to credit, just as they now do at automated banking machines. SECRET WILL BE OUT  Last fall, Lady's Secret was 1 to 2 to win the Ruffian Handicap, 1-5 to win the Maskette Mile and 1-20 to win the Beldame Stakes. She is about 1-100 to be named Horse of the Year when the seal is broken on the envelope at 1:30 P.M. Friday in the winner's circle at Aqueduct. Lady's Secret, a gray daughter of Secretariat who won 10 of 15 starts and more than $1.8 million as a 4-year-old in 1986, may not have been the best horse in the country last year - she could not beat Precisionist, who could not beat Turkoman -but she was by far the most popular and the most accomplished.The announcement will be simulcast to tracks around the country, and the show will go on even if snow wipes out racing at Aqueduct. The award will be presented officially Feb. 6 at the Eclipse Awards dinner in San Francisco. CURIOUS CHOICE  Passengers flying from New York to Miami on Eastern Airlines this winter are wooed to the races at Hialeah with a short promotional film that comes on before the in-flight movie. Part of the advertising spot shows an unidentified race featuring a close finish among three horses in colorful silks.Only aficionados will recognize the race and what a curious choice it is, marking one of the track's most embarrassing episodes. The horses are Chief's Crown, Proud Truth and Stephan's Odyssey, who crossed the wire in that order in the 1985 Flamingo Stakes. The track stewards disqualified Chief's Crown for a phantom foul, and their decision was overruled by state officials a week later after a hearing. Chief's Crown was reinstated as the winner, but those who bet on him lost their money - hardly a proposition that will attract new customers. PHANTOM JET'S SCHEDULE  Phantom Jet, who looked like a Kentucky Derby prospect winning the O'Farrell Stakes in his 3-year-old debut at Hialeah Wednesday, will make his next start in either the Everglades Feb. 7 or the Dan Chappell Stakes nine days later, then run in the Flamingo Stakes Feb. 28. The colt's pedigree suggests short-windedness - he is by Tri Jet and a Mr. Prospector mare. But Phantom Jet has been finishing well and acting like a colt who will handle longer distances. SWIFTEST OF SWIFT  P's Rambling, the greyhound who has attracted more fans than any horse has this winter in Miami, makes the most important start of his career Saturday night in the final of the $100,000 Hollywoodian Stakes at the Hollywood dog track. The 27-month-old greyhound is eight for eight this season, and in his last seven starts at three-eighths of a mile he has run the seven fastest times in track history. He tuned up for the finals last Saturday night by winning a semifinal race in the world-record time of 36.43 seconds.

Mr. Koch arrived here Wednesday night after a four-day visit to Poland.Earlier, Dr. Losonci, an internist, had shown the Mayor through a badly overcrowded, antiquated and underequipped hospital and nursing home that the Jewish community maintains for its aged. ''That hospital should be torn down and a new one put up immediately,'' Mr. Koch said. A Separate InstitutionBecause of dietary laws, Hungary's Jews are permitted to operate a separate institution, with Government help, in a country where all medical services are Government-owned.In recent years, Hungary's Jews has been allowed to resume a long-interrupted relationship with international Jewish bodies. As a consequence, it receives $1 million a year from the American Joint Distribution Committee. Janos Gonda, deputy secretary general of the Jewish Board, said the money was spent mainly on caring for the elderly, providing meals for the homebound and maintaining Talmud-Torah schools for the young.Community leaders said much more money was needed.

If you bark your order to a waiter while scooting to a table, and have the dexterity to eat noodles in broth with chopsticks, it's possible to enjoy a savory lunch and be back on the street with three-quarters of your lunch hour left over. Try the wonton mein, a deep bowl of flavorful broth filled with thin whole-wheat noodles and pork dumplings ($2.25). Platters of cold roast duck and chicken, as well as a house favorite, salty boiled chicken, are good accompaniments - especially dabbed with some megavolt hot sauce. (Open 10 A.M. to 9:30 P.M.; $6 to $10 for a three-course meal. Tuesday to Sunday. No credit cards.) Great Shanghai (27 Division Street, 966-7663): The seaside cuisine of Shanghai is the specialty at this large, bustling spot favored by many Chinese families. Oriental fondue is impeccably fresh and tasty: the tables hold a gas burner on which a pot of chicken broth simmers. A waiter drops in cubes of tofu, Chinese cabbage, noodles and various vegetables, and diners cook their own main ingredients, which range from sea scallops and squid to thin slices of lamb and beef. (Open 11:30 A.M. to 10 P.M. Monday to Thursday; Friday and Saturday 11:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; $10 to $15 for a three-course meal. American Express.) HSF (46 Bowery, south of Canal Street, 374-1319): This clattering and colorful restaurant buzzes all day long, from dim sum breakfast until midnight. The dining room is a gastronomic roller derby where waiters spin around the room behind carts overloaded with small portions of dumplings, roast duck, shredded chicken and all varieties of shrimp, squid, pork, fish and pastries. Turnover is fast and furious, so the food is generally hot and fresh when you get it. The eyes-bigger-than-stomach syndrome is endemic here. (Open 7:30 A.M. to midnight daily; $12 to $20 for four dim sum entrees. Cash only at breakfast and lunch; American Express accepted at dinner.) King Fung (20 Elizabeth Street, south of Canal Street, 964-5256): This big, brassy newcomer is well suited to a large communal dinner, and there are plenty of first-rate preparations to keep everyone happy. Peking duck is a real delight, crackling outside and succulent within; other good choices are the dry scallop soup, shrimp in lemon sauce, steamed dumplings, and lobster Chinese style, served with black beans. Waiters are friendly and energetic. (Open 8 A.M. to 11 P.M. daily; $12 to $20 for a three-course meal. American Express, MasterCard, Visa.) Yuet Tung Restaurant (40 Bowery Street, 608-6383): The name ''Hakka'' translates roughly as ''guest people,'' and it describes an ancient Chinese subculture, originally from the north, that exists today in the southern provinces around Canton. Not only do the Hakka have their own dialect, but they also have a distinctive cuisine characterized by various organ meats. This trim, inexpensive restaurant offers an unadulterated introduction to such specialties as crispy pork intestines, sizzling fried pork legs, pork cake with preserved fish, chicken kidneys with vegetables, and beef tripe with sour cabbage - rustic and assertive all. For the less adventuresome, there is a tasty baked, salted, shredded chicken. (Open 11 A.M. to 4 A.M. daily; $12 to $18 for a three-course meal. No credit cards.) Peking Duck House Restaurant (22 Mott Street, 227-1810): The name says it all. If you are looking for a succulent rendition of Peking duck, try this unassuming and lively second-story restaurant where the art has been honed to a reliably satisfying science. A whole duck, which feeds up to six as part of a multi-course meal, costs $24. (Open 11:30 A.M. to 10:30 P.M. Sunday to Thursday; 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday; $12 to $18 for a three-course meal. American Express.) 20 Mott Street (20 Mott Street, 964-0380): My favorite dish at this sprawling, three-level establishment is Chinese-style roast duck with black bean sauce. The combination of rich moist meat, caramel-toned skin and slightly salty black beans is superb. Hard-shell crabs smothered with black bean sauce are sweet and delicious, too, as are deep-fried squid and scallops served over lettuce with a light sweet sauce. (Open 8 A.M. to 1 A.M. daily; $12 to $18 for a three-course meal. American Express, MasterCard, Visa.) The Nice Restaurant (35 East Broadway, between Catherine and Market Streets, 406-9510): This has been among the hottest spots in Chinatown for the past two years, and deservedly so. Despite its size and frenetic pace, the food and service remain remarkably consistent. Don't miss the roast suckling pig, presented over a layer of sweet-cooked soybeans. Other winners include minced squab in lettuce leaves, salt-baked chicken and deep-fried prawns. A preparation called soyed squab in a pot is exquisite - that is, if you don't mind seeing the entire bird, head and all, looking up at you from the pot. (Open 8 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. daily; $12 to $20 for a three-course meal. American Express.)",9360948,9360999,9360966

But the impact of the scandal is being felt far beyond the executive suites of the giant brewing company and the other concerns that helped in manipulatingThe Guinness affair is a scandal of the sort that the British public finds irresistible: the high and mighty brought low by underhanded dealings and common greed. But the impact of the scandal is being felt far beyond the executive suites of the giant brewing company and the other concerns that helped in manipulating Guinness's stock price.The case has tarnished the reputation of London's booming financial district, prompted calls for tighter regulation of the securities market and even threatened to become a liability for the Government of Margaret Thatcher in the nation's next general election.In a speech earlier this week, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said that the affair had caused ''great anxiety'' and posed a ''threat to the entire basis of trust which still predominates in our business life.'' An Alcoholic 'Dallas'The Guinness affair has been dubbed an ''alcoholic 'Dallas,' '' with Ernest Saunders, the recently dismissed chairman of Guinness P.L.C., cast as J. R. Ewing. Since the Government announced its investigation at the start of December, the faces of Mr. Saunders and other leading characters in the Guinness saga have become as instantly recognizable to the public as Britain's leading entertainers and sports figures.Their shady maneuverings occurred during the fiercely contested battle early last year for the Distillers Company, the leading maker of Scotch whisky, in which Guinness's $3.8 billion offer ultimately edged out a bid by the Argyll Group P.L.C.During the closing stages of the fight, Guinness illicitly orchestrated purchases of its own stock and arranged to pay off the buyers. The resulting sharp run-up in its share price enabled its cash-and-stock offer to prevail. The brewer's adviser on the deal was London's leading merchant bank for mergers, Morgan Grenfell & Company, and last week, under pressure from the Bank of England, two of the bank's top officers - Christopher Reeves, the chief executive, and Graham Walsh, head of the corporate finance department - resigned. A Secret NetworkGuinness's secret share-buying network included not only blue-chip London financial institutions, but even a Swiss bank and the Wall Street inside trader Ivan F. Boesky. In fact, the investigation here began after the American Securities and Exchange Commission passed information of Mr. Boesky's Guinness dealings to British inspectors.In the wake of the Guinness affair, some corporate executives have tried to point out that the case shows only that takeover rules were violated, not that mergers generally are unsound. But takeovers become much more entangled in politics in Britain than in the United States.Now, the pace of takeovers will probably taper off dramatically, merchant bankers say. Indeed, with just a few days left in January, the value of corporate takeover bids begun this month has been about $600 million, compared with $6 billion in January 1986 and with a monthly average in 1986 of $2 billion, according to Acquisitions Monthly, a trade journal. Broader Economic DebateBy raising questions about ethics in the City, the Guinness scandal has also fueled a broader debate over Britain's economic policy. The Thatcher Government has opened up the City to new competitors and new practices in a market-liberalization drive that culminated with last October's ''Big Bang.''Supporters have praised the market opening as just the sort of tonic Britain needs, making an important domestic industry more competitive internationally. It has also brought social changes, as the clubbish old order in the financial district gave way to a meritocracy, with East Enders competing on equal footing against Eton graduates.The liberalization raised salaries dramatically, especially for young stock traders, but the new wealth in the City has magnified the yawning gap between Britain's affluent southeast and impoverished north, between booming finance and declining industry. 'Casino Capitalism'To many, the huge profits collected by young financiers in the merger game seem quick and easy, an undeserved byproduct of ''casino capitalism.'' Further, the perception is that some of these profits come from suspect dealings because takeover rules are vague or enforcement is lax.Last week, for example, Guinness confirmed that it was investigating unexplained payments of $38 million to 11 companies that may have been involved in the scheme to manipulate its stock price. Two of the concerns, which received nearly $9 million, are controlled by Gerald Ronson, a respected British businessman. Once his companies were named, Mr. Ronson immediately returned the funds to Guinness.Mr. Ronson admitted that the payment was a fee for large purchases of Guinness shares and that his concern was to be repaid for any losses on its Guinness holding - a apparent violation of British corporate law. Yet in a letter, Mr. Ronson, a frequent investor in takeover situations, explained, ''This did not seem to me at the time to be in any way unusual or sinister.'' Criticism From Both PartiesCritics regard changes in the City as symbolic of Britain's ills and typical of the wrong-headedness of Thatcherite economic policy. But, significantly, the criticism of the City has come not only from the opposition, but also from within the Conservative Party and from leading business groups, such as the Confederation of British Industry.Sir Anthony Grant, a Conservative Member of Parliament, expressed the fear that the City seems to be increasingly under the sway of people ''long on cunning but short on morals.''Edward Heath, the former Conservative Prime Minister, said, ''This is another aspect of the unacceptable face of capitalism,'' using a phrase he coined more than a decade ago. Incumbent Government Blamed''The blame for these events cannot be shuffled off on two or three individuals,'' said Robin Cook, the Labor Party's spokesman on the securities industry. ''It is this Government that has encouraged the takeover stampede. The Government has created a climate in the City that anything goes.''A growing public animosity to hostile takeovers appeared in the recent $1.8 billion bid by BTR P.L.C., an acquisitive conglomerate, for Pilkington Brothers P.L.C., a glassmaker. The Government was criticized for refusing to thwart the bid by referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on ''public interest'' grounds, even though the combination would not reduce industrial competition.BTR withdrew its bid last week, citing ''commercial reasons.'' But Pilkington's chairman, Antony Pilkington, conceded that the intensifying debate about ''British industrial strategy probably helped us.'' More Regulation ExpectedBecause of the Guinness scandal, bankers and institutional investors say that more clear-cut regulation of the financial district now seems inevitable. ''We're certainly moving toward a more regulated environment, instead of the gentlemen's rules of the past,'' said Henry DeVismes, a director of Kleinwort Benson International Investment Ltd., a large fund-management concern. ''Give London five years, and it will be like Wall Street.''A growing number of politicians say that the British system should be replaced by an independent statutory agency somewhat like the United States S.E.C. ''With the increasing internationalization of financial markets, we should look toward a statutory body,'' said Peter Tapsell, a Tory Member of Parliament and former Treasury Minister.Even the Prime Minister's position on self-regulation appears to have softened. Just this week the Trade Secretary told Parliament that the Government was reviewing regulation of corporate takeovers and said it was considering tighter controls. Longer Prison Terms ProposedMajor legislative initiatives are rarely pushed during an election year, but the Government is trying to demonstrate its resolve to pursue improper dealings in the City. For example, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, said last week that the maximum prison sentence for insider trading would probably soon be lengthened from two years to seven.Others contend that what Britain most needs is clear-cut rules for takeovers, which are consistently applied. The form of the regulatory oversight is a lesser consideration, they say.''The real problem with merger regulation here is that the rules aren't black and white,'' said A. Gary Klesch, chairman of Quadrex Securities Ltd. in London and a former United States Treasury official. ''So they are subject to political pressures and favoritism.''",9361071,9360840,9361012

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,A WORRY FOR LABOR,"LEAD: The sudden end of the Long Island Rail Road strike, a relief to 110,000 commuters, has left union leaders pondering whether they lost not only this particular strike but also the strike as a weapon in future labor disputes. Labor experts fear thatThe sudden end of the Long Island Rail Road strike, a relief to 110,000 commuters, has left union leaders pondering whether they lost not only this particular strike but also the strike as a weapon in future labor disputes. Labor experts fear thatCongress, by stepping so swiftly into what was essentially a local dispute, has set a worrisome precedent. Although it has acted to halt or avert past railroad work stoppages, they have either been - or threatened to become - national or regional strikes.In signing the measure Wednesday, President Reagan expressed similar fears. ''Even in those cases where the national well-being and safety are directly affected,'' he said in a statement, ''the Congress and this Administration agree that the Federal Government should be reluctant to interfere in the collective bargaining process. ''This is especially true in the case of rail commuter services that serve discrete localities.'' Provisions of ActUnder the Congressional action -which was written by Representative Norman F. Lent, Republican of Far Rockaway, L.I., and supported by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, as well as Governor Cuomo - there will be a 60-day cooling-off period during which the five railroad unions still without agreements will attempt to negotiate settlements. If they are unsuccessful at the end of 50 days, a panel of arbitrators will recommend a settlement to Congress, which could then impose it, revise it or do nothing at all.Should any of the five unions not come to terms - and Congress not act - it is possible that its members could walk off their jobs again March 17, shutting the railroad for the sixth time in 15 years. That is an unsettling prospect for workers who already have contracts, not to mention the railroad's management and their customers.On the other hand, the threat of a Congressionally-imposed settlement is also chilling. ''It's been a traditional position not only of the labor movement but both political parties that compulsory arbitration is anathema to the whole concept of free collective bargaining,'' said Walter C. Wallace, a member of the National Mediation Board who was in charge of the talks to head off the Long Island strike. 'Could Be Devastating'Edward Yule Jr., general chairman of the United Transportation Union -which represents the Long Island's conductors, who settled before the strike, and its track workers, who came to terms during it - acknowledged that the negotiations had bogged down when Congress stepped in.He says, however, that the repercussions from the Congressional action ''for the labor movement on the Long Island could be devastating.''It was Mr. Yule who fought off attempts to bring the Long Island's workers under New York State's Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by public employees. He took the case to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in 1982 that the workers retained their right to strike under the Federal Railway Labor Act.Since then, a new section of that act - 9A - was added especially for publicly owned and operated commuter railroads like the L.I.R.R. It calls for the appointment of two Presidential emergency boards to study a contract dispute and two 120-day cooling-off periods. 'An Afterthought'Charles M. Rehmus, a former dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial Relations who is now an arbitrator, calls 9A ''an afterthought'' that was enacted ''without careful deliberation.'' He said it extends the governing principle of the Federal railway labor legislation - ''on the one hand maintain the right to strike and on the other discourage it.''Indeed, as the strike deadline drew near, Mr. Wallace of the National Mediation Board repeatedly cited the frustrations that had grown on both sides of the table since the railroad's last contract with its workers expired in December 1984. Instead of adding yet another cooling-off period, Mr. Wallace wonders whether Congress ought to be looking for a new way to resolve commuter rail disputes.Although officials of the Long Island were jubiliant when Congress ended the walkout after 11 days, the task of getting the nation's busiest commuter rail line back into gear would undoubtedly have been easier had the strike come to a natural, negotiated conclusion.As it now stands, the railroad's president, Bruce C. McIver, will have to hold together an operation whose 6,600 workers are split several ways. The engineers, who began the strike on Jan. 18, want to be paid more than the conductors and are taking the matter to arbitration. The car workers and electricians are quarreling over which jobs fall within their jurisdiction. The signal workers want to limit the number of workers hired by outside contractors the railroad has turned to for its major rebuilding projects.But perhaps the most serious division is between the 80 percent of the line's workers who have agreed to new contracts or accepted binding arbitration - and who have already received checks for about $5,000 in back pay or will soon be getting them - and the 20 percent still working for 1984 wages. They will not get the back pay and raises until they come to agreement.''My early impression is that the employees want to put this behind them,'' said Mr. McIver, who expects service to resume tomorrow. But, he added, ''I think it could turn into a liability if we are not able to make progress in the bargaining.''",9361211,9360929,9360859

Anderson, a 55-year-old psychiatrist, was unintentionally defamed by the movie.The trial centering on ''The Bell Jar,'' a 1979 film of Sylvia Plath's novel, ended here today in Federal District Court when both sides agreed to a judgment that Dr. Jane V. Anderson, a 55-year-old psychiatrist, was unintentionally defamed by the movie.Dr. Anderson, whose suit asked $6 million, is to receive $150,000. The monetary judgment was against 10 of the 14 defendants.It did not apply to CBS Inc., Home Box Office Inc., Time-Life Films Inc. and La Marca Productions Ltd., which would not agree to the judgment, according to their attorney, Alexander H. Pratt Jr. Both sides said they were ''very pleased'' with the settlement, but they disagreed about whether it set a precedent in the issue of an individual's right of privacy and an artist's freedom of expression.Harry L. Manion 3d, chief attorney for Dr. Anderson, claimed a ''complete victory and vindication'' as his client stood by smiling. ''I think this is a precedent,'' Mr. Manion said. ''If you're dealing with autobiographical material, you must exercise due care to ascertain whether anybody you portray defames or says something false about a living person.''Dr. Anderson contended she was the basis for the character Joan Gilling in both the book and movie, although only the movie was at issue in the case. The Other SideBut Victor A. Kovner, the attorney for Ted Hughes, Britain's poet laureate, who was Miss Plath's husband and administrator of her estate, said he did not think the judgment set a precedent. He was also a defendant.Mr. Kovner, who specializes in First Amendment issues, added: ''Nonentheless, the law as it now stands provides insufficient protection for authors of fiction. Until the courts recognize that fiction is entitled to a special measure of constitutional protection, claims by people who identify themselves with one character or another will continue to threaten expression by authors of fiction.''The agreement was in the form of a consent judgment - an official court document that is the final statement filed in the case. It bypasses the jury.Entered into the record by Judge Robert E. Keeton, the document says that ''judgment is hereby entered for the plaintiff'' except for the four defendants and that all parties waive rights of appeal.All 14 defendants agree, it says, that the film ''unintentionally defamed'' Dr. Anderson ''in that it coincidentally but falsely seems to portray her as having homosexual inclinations; as having made a suicide attempt; as encouraging another person to commit suicide, and as a person who committed suicide by hanging.''It also stipulates that in future distributions of the movie, a disclaimer will be made prominent, stating that everything in the film is fictitious and that ''any similarity to living or actual persons is purely coincidental.'' The movie has a disclaimer but in small lettering. Details of Payment Not DisclosedThe other defendants are the Avco Embassy Pictures Corporation; Brandt-Todd Company; Bonime Productions Ltd.; Jerrold T. Brandt Jr.; Michael Todd Jr.; Marjorie Kellogg; Lawrence Peerce; Robert Goldston, and Vestron Inc. They would not disclose the arrangements for paying Dr. Anderson the $150,000 judgment.Dr. Anderson dropped charges of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional stress.Mr. Manion said the defense approached him about a consent judgment after the film was shown in court on Tuesday, and Dr. Anderson, questioned by Mr. Manion, told what in the film she found objectionable.But Mr. Pratt depicted the efforts at a settlement as mutual.Mr. Kovner issued a statement on behalf of Mr. Hughes, describing the agreement as ''a fair settlement.''He said that it ''confirms that there was no wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Hughes and that, to the extent the plaintiff was defamed, it was by the motion picture alone, not the novel, and occurred unintentionally and purely by coincidence.''''Mr. Hughes never asserted that Dr. Anderson was a homosexual,'' he said, adding that he never had any knowledge of her before the start of the suit. And, Mr. Kovner said, Mr. Hughes and the Plath estate would pay no part of the $150,000.Mr. Kovner also distributed copies of a 1961 letter by Miss Plath to her editor in England that said, ''No, I've not forgotten about the libel issue'' and that listed characters who are and are not based on real people. ''Jane (I'm changing her name to Joan) is fictitious,'' she wrote. 'A Vindication of Me'Dr. Anderson said at a news conference that the amount of the judgment would cover her current legal costs but probably not all she had spent since her suit was first filed in 1982.Dr. Anderson said she felt the judgment was ''a vindication of me.''''The most important thing I wanted to get out of the lawsuit,'' she said, was ''my reputation.''Dr. Anderson, who is also an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said she had been unable to teach or write papers during the last seven or eight years because of her distress over her ''defamation'' and that at first she had kept silent about what she perceived as her well-known link with the Gilling character.''It's such a relief to be able to talk about all this, she said. ''Now I feel I can go on with my life.''",9360858,9360845,9360835,9360879,9360860
http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,REAGAN CLASHES WITH DEMOCRATS AT WHITE HOUSE,"LEAD: President Reagan and the Democratic leaders of Congress clashed sharply today at a White House meeting on the Federal budget and other domestic policy matters.President Reagan and the Democratic leaders of Congress clashed sharply today at a White House meeting on the Federal budget and other domestic policy matters.The tone of the meeting, described as ''very confrontational'' by one participant, could foreshadow a turbulent two years as the Democratic leaders and the Republican White House struggle for control of the legislative agenda and marshal their forces for the 1988 elections.The tense mood at the White House was reflected across Capitol Hill as the legislative schedule for the new Congress began to accelerate. Two angry Senators, Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Lawton Chiles, Democrat of Florida, shouted down an Administration official who was trying to defend proposed cuts in drug treatment programs.  [ Page B9. ]  Struggle on Arms Signaled A bipartisan group of four lawmakers said they would introduce legislation forcing the Administration to abide by the terms of the unratified second treaty on limiting strategic arms, even though the President has said he will abrogate the treaty and veto any legislation that mandated compliance.  [ Page A7. ]  ''What we saw is maybe the opening round of what the Democrats plan for the next two years,'' Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, told reporters outside the White House. ''Coming on strong, talking about getting a trade bill out early, really giving the President the business on the budget.''''I think it's the opening gun of 1988,'' added Mr. Dole, a leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination. ''I think there's going to be confrontation between the Democratic leadership and the President, and that's all right with me.''A senior White House official described the meeting as ''frank and intense but not nastily personal.'' The session was scheduled for 30 minutes but lasted more than an hour, and the participants ''ended up with a pledge to work together on these things,'' the official said.However, the first major struggle between Congress and the White House could come as early as Friday, when the President is expected to veto legislation authorizing projects to clean up the nation's waterways at a total cost of up to $18 billion. Asked if the leadership had the votes to override such a veto, Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the new Speaker of the House, said, ''We think we do.''White House officials have denounced the clean water bill, which was approved by lopsided votes of 93 to 6 in the Senate and 408 to 6 in the House, as a ''budget buster.'' Mr. Wright replied that the measure ''is not budget-busting legislation by any stretch of the imagination.''A letter was sent to the President today by 76 senators, more than enough to override a veto, asking him to sign the bill. The letter acknowledged Mr. Reagan's objections to the cost of the measure but called it ''an investment which will repay dividends of a clean environment for years to come.'' New Alignment 'Evident'The meeting today was the first between Mr. Reagan and the new leaders of the 100th Congress. For the first time since the President took office six years ago, both chambers are controlled by the Democrats, and the senior White House official said that this new political alignment was ''clearly evident'' in the climate of the session.''They are in charge of Congress,'' the official said of the Democrats, ''with all the power that entails and all the responsibility.''Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said that the Administration was well aware that it must forge a new relationship with the Democratic Congress.''If you look at the record from Jan. 5 forward,'' he said, referring to the day the new Congress convened, ''we have had a tone of cooperation. And, we will continue to do so.''But there was little evidence of that cooperation today in a heated discussion over the budget deficit and how to reduce it, according to several participants. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Senate Democratic leader, proposed that the President sit down with Congressional leaders from both parties to work out a compromise package of budget-reducing measures. Byrd Move on Compromise''I said, 'Why don't we sit down and stop the partisan sniping and finger-pointing ?' '' Mr. Byrd told reporters. He added that in such a meeting ''each of us would have to give up something.''The idea behind the proposal is that any serious deficit-reducing effort requires very unpopular measures and that neither party is willing to take the first step and risk political retaliation.The President rejected the idea of a meeting now, arguing that since he had already sent his budget to Capitol Hill the Democrats should now lay out their ideas.The senior White House official called the Byrd proposal ''premature'' but did not rule out such a meeting later in the year. ''We have to wait for the other side to lay its cards on the table and then see what happens,'' he said.The core of the conflict between Democratic leaders and the President remains what it has been for years: how to reduce the budget deficit. As Representative Tony Coelho of California, the House Democratic whip, said after the meeting, ''You have different priorities about where Government money should be spent.'' Military Budget at IssueThe Democrats want to reduce the military budget, but in his State of the Union Message Mr. Reagan adamantly argued for a 3 percent increase in Pentagon spending on top of an increase to make up for inflation.The White House continues to suggest cuts in domestic programs, but today members of Congress from both parties have been attacking proposed reductions in programs ranging from education to drug treatment.Lawmakers from both parties agree that a sizable revenue increase is also necessary, but the President has refused to consider new taxes.James C. Miller 3d, the budget director, told the House Budget Committee today that the prospects for a budget summit meeting ''would be higher'' if the leaders pledged to keep new taxes off the table.However, Mr. Byrd clearly signaled that taxes would have to be part of any budget compromise. ''We will leave all the options open,'' he said pointedly. ''All of them.''",9360837,9360853,9360836,9360850,9360851,9360840,9360846,9360854

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,Concert: Kurt Masur With Gutierrez at Piano,"LEAD: IT would be difficult to name two composers more dissimilar in temperament and taste than Hindemith and Chopin, who found themselves oddly coupled on last evening's New York Philharmonic program. Kurt Masur, the guest conductor, began with Hindemith's Concert Music for Strings and Brass, one of those works that reflect with startling accuracy the German composer's personality.IT would be difficult to name two composers more dissimilar in temperament and taste than Hindemith and Chopin, who found themselves oddly coupled on last evening's New York Philharmonic program. Kurt Masur, the guest conductor, began with Hindemith's Concert Music for Strings and Brass, one of those works that reflect with startling accuracy the German composer's personality. Anyone who knew him or saw him perform would recognize him clearly in this 1930 piece, a ruddy, vigorous and technically admirable but rather mechanical showpiece. Mr. Masur and the Philharmonic made the most of this lustily sonorous score's good points and made the others tolerable.The Chopin, his Concerto in F minor, brought forward Horacio Gutierrez as piano soloist. Mr. Guttierrez, whose credentials as a virtuoso have been validated often in other music, had little trouble making a brilliant impression in this music's scales and heavily embroidered passagework. He had the fingers for the job, no question. One missed, however, the rhythmic elasticity and impulsive sweep of the natural Chopinzee (to borrow a term from James Gibbons Huneker). The piano tone tended to be bright and rather hard, which sometimes lent this much-abused concerto a welcome feeling of masculinity and spine but also cost the performance something of the elegant finish that top-flight Chopin pianism must have.It would not be fair to understate the virtues of Mr. Gutierrez's performance, which did not lack for its episodes of melodic grace and subtle inflection. Still, it was Chopin that too often turned blunt and stiff just when a famous phrase was trying hard to blossom. This concerto can easily be weakened by treating it as a series of ladylike sighs and languishing poses; Mr. Gutierrez went a little too far in the other direction.Listening to the orchestra bustling through Hindemith's piece reminded one that Bruckner was the composer he himself conducted best in his late years, possibly because their music shares a care for structural clarity, a four-square heartiness and a fondness for brassy outbursts. At a guess, based on his effective treatment of this Hindemith score, Mr. Masur would be a splendid man for Bruckner.He also proved to be a splendid conductor for Mendelssohn, whose ''Scottish'' Symphony closed the program. His concern for detail was scrupulous, but that did not inhibit the orchestra's ability to carry a long melodic line. In the Adagio, for instance, the first violins seemed to be singing the main melody with the freedom of a great soloist. Mr. Masur clearly knows how to float a cantabile phrase or series of phrases in a way that sounds utterly rhapsodic while maintaining the music's basic pulse and structural framework.THE PROGRAM - NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, Kurt Masur, conductor; Horacio Gutierrez, pianist.

It will also assume some of Arvida's liabilities.Arvida, based in Boca Raton, Fla., develops residential, resort and business communities, and currently operates more than 20 projects in Florida, Georgia and California. The company was acquired by Disney in June 1984 for $200 million in stock, apparently as a defensive move to avoid a hostile takeover.Disney had been rumored for the last few weeks to be interested in selling Arvida, which reported operating income of $41.8 million on revenues of $305.1 million in 1986. The deal, announced after the close of the markets today, is expected to close May 30.Erwin Okun, vice president for Disney, declined to say what the company planned to do with the proceeds from the sale, but analysts said the company was likely to buy back stock or save the cash for a major acquisition. The deal does not include Walt Disney World's 28,000 acres near Orlando, Fla., which are considered a prime asset.''We have no plans now for the disposition of funds from the sale,'' Mr. Okun said. ''The sale will help us focus on our core businesses.'' Town Center Mall SaleIn the fourth quarter of 1986, Disney sold its 50 percent interest in the Town Center Mall in Boca Raton, Fla., to JMB Realty, which held the other half. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Mr. Okun said the price was included in the Arvida deal.JMB Realty, a privately held real estate concern, owns or controls about $10 billion in domestic real estate and operates several public partnerships.''We're pleased and excited about this acquisition,'' said Neil G. Bluhm, JMB's president. ''Arvida is the premier company in its field, with a well-deserved reputation for quality and excellence, both in its developments and in its people.''Disney's purchase of Arvida, which at the time was 70 percent owned by the Bass family of Texas, helped the Basses gain a foothold at the entertainment company and allowed them to influence the decision to bring in a new team of managers led by Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, and Frank G.

And that's just what's in store tomorrow at the Symphony Space, which will commemorate the birthday with a 12-hour free concert entitled ''Wall-to-Wall Schubert,'' scheduled to last from 11 in the morning until 11 at night.The participating artists include the pianists Andre-Michel Schub, Claude Frank, Gilbert Kalish and Ruth Laredo; the soprano Dawn Upshaw; the baritone Richard Frisch; the violinists Ani Kavafian, Ida Kavafian and Mark Peskanov; the violist Walter Trampler; the cellists Fred Sherry and Timothy Eddy; the flutist Eugenia Zukerman, and the Mendelssohn and Alexander String Quartets.From 5 to 6:30 P.M., the Overture to ''Rosamunde'' and the Symphony No. 8 (''Unfinished'') will be played by members of the Mannes College of Music, under the direction of Jorge Mester; audience members will be invited to join in. The concert is open to the public, on a first-come, first-served basis; for those who can't get a seat, the festivities will be broadcast live on WNYC-FM (93.9).The program emphasizes the monumental Schubert. Instead of a day full of songs, as might have been expected from a similar endeavor a few years ago, there will be a concentration on Schubert's large works -the mammoth Octet in F, which opens the program at 11 A.M.; the ''Trout'' Quintet at 6:45 P.M., and, to close the program, the great Strings Quintet in C, a masterpiece written literally on the composer's deathbed, lost for some 40 years, then discovered and hailed as one of the most beautiful works of music ever written. Latest Tribute to ComposerIndeed, the only representation of Schubert's several hundred songs will be in a performance of the cycle ''Die Winterreise'' by Mr. Frisch at 3:30, a rendition of ''Der Hirt auf dem Felsen'' by Ms. Upshaw at 2:45, and a few uncollected songs, again with Ms. Upshaw, between 1 and 1:30.Other highlights include a performance of the String Quartet in D minor (''Death and the Maiden'') by the Alexander String Quartet at 12:20; the Piano Trio in E flat, played by Myron Lutzke, Robert Merfeld and Ruth Waterman, at 2; the ''Wanderer'' Fantasy in C for piano at 8:15; the String Quartet in G minor, played by the Mendelssohn Quartet, at 8:45, and the Piano Sonata in B flat, played by Mr. Frank, at 9:30.This is only the latest in a continuing series of ''wall-to-wall'' concerts at Symphony Space. Past presentations have included tributes to such composers as Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Charles Ives, Aaron Copland, John Cage and Richard Rodgers. Symphony Space is at the corner of Broadway and 95th Street. Admission is free. Information: 864-1414. A Children's PresentationThe Symphony Space concert may be the grandest of Schubert celebrations this weekend, but it is not the only one. The Schubert Society of New York will present a daylong tribute tomorrow at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Performers include the sopranos Jeannie Miller and Brenda Harris, the baritone Ben Holt, the pianists Zita Zohar and Caroline Stoessinger, the violinist Dora Schwarzberg, the cellist Dimitri Yablonsky, the horn player David Jolley, the clarinetist Gervase de Peyer, the Alexander String Quartet, and the New Amsterdam Singers under the direction of Clara Longstreth.The day's program begins at 10:30 A.M. with a children's presentation called ''Franz Schubert in Vienna'' with dancers, actors, instrumentalists and chorus, featuring choreography by Kalya Yannatos. From 1:30 to 4 P.M., an ensemble will present a program of Schubert's chamber music. At 4:30, Ms. Stoessinger, the director of the Schubert Society, will present a lecture and demonstration called ''The Romantic Schubert.'' Finally, at 7:30, there will be a gala ''Schubertiad,'' a program of works in the style of the informal evenings of music for which the composer was famed. Admission is free; information: 662-2133.And for those who still want to hear more Schubert, the New York Concertino Ensemble, with the pianist Oxana Yablonskaya, will present the Octet in F and the ''Trout'' Quintet at Trinity Lutheran Church, 31st Avenue and 37th Street, in Astoria, Queens, Sunday afternoon at 3. Tickets are $11; $9 for students and the elderly. Information: (718) 626-9176.",9360939

Wesleyan officials and the Middletown police said no sexual assaults were reported last year on the campus.The board said the students' accusations were protected by the principle of free speech, but that their actions were ''carefully planned'' and intended to ''impede the normal progress of the tours.''The board's recommendation was sent to the dean of Wesleyan's undergraduate school, Edgar F. Beckham. A university spokesman said the recommendation likely would be followed.METRO DATELINES",9360922,9360912

http://www.nitf.org/IPTC/NITF/3.3/specification/dtd/nitf-3-3.dtd,NEWARK BISHOP SEEKING TO BLESS UNWED COUPLES,"LEAD: The Episcopal Bishop of Newark, bolstered by a diocesan report, called on the church yesterday to ''open its eyes to reality'' by recognizing and blessing nonmarital relationships, including those between homosexuals.The Episcopal Bishop of Newark, bolstered by a diocesan report, called on the church yesterday to ''open its eyes to reality'' by recognizing and blessing nonmarital relationships, including those between homosexuals.According to national church officials, the recommendation goes well beyond the stand taken by the governing body of the Episcopal Church, the General Convention, and beyond statements of individual dioceses.The report, prepared by a local committee of clergy and lay people, supports the position of the head of the diocese, Bishop John Shelby Spong, although it is opposed by elements locally and nationally. The Bishop called on the national church to recognize such relationships just as the Newark diocese will be considering the same option.''Ideally, homosexual couples would find within the community of the congregation the same recognition and affirmation which nutures and sustains heterosexual couples in their relationship, including, where appropriate, liturgies which recognize and bless such relationships,'' the 15-page report stated. 'Other Patterns' ExistThe report will be presented to a two-day convention of the Newark diocese that begins today. If it is adopted, a committee will begin drafting a liturgy that would be used in blessing unions between homosexuals and unmarried couples. The press officer for the diocese, the Rev. Leslie Smith, said the ceremonies would not be a marriage ceremony, which he said was to be performed between a man and a woman.The church blessing on the homosexual union, he said, would ''recognize that there are other patterns that exist.''He cited a recent comment by Bishop Spong in which he said, ''I find it difficult to believe that a church that blesses dogs in a Virginia fox hunt can't find a way to bless life-giving, lasting relationships between human beings.''The Newark Episcopal Diocese, with 55,000 members, is among the nation's most liberal, as is its bishop. Mr. Smith said that ''the chances for the study are excellent'' when it comes before the local convention. Good Chance of Passing''If it can pass in any diocese, it can pass in this one,'' he said.On a national level, the proposal is certain to face opposition. ''The church's teaching is centered on God, not changing social customs,'' said an opponent of the recommendations, the Rev. Fleming Rutledge of Grace Episcopal Church in Manhattan.The General Convention of the church, which represents 2.8 million Episcopalians nationwide, rejected a similar proposal in 1979. Bishop Spong said yesterday that the church's current leader, Presiding Bishop Edmond Lee Browning, supported the proposal.Bishop Browning would not comment yesterday on the new report, saying that to do so would interfere with the church's legislative process, according to the deputy press officer at the church's national headquarters in Manhattan, Janet Vetter.In the Episcopal church, the bishops have a great deal of authority. In 1977, for example, Bishop Paul Moore Jr. of New York, ordained an avowed lesbian as a priest, although his church does not allow for the ordination of homosexuals.Like Roman Catholic and most Protestant doctrine, Epsicopal teachings only approve of sex between men and women who are married. But national Episcopal officials said that an individual bishop could bless homosexual unions despite church doctrine.The Newark report was prepared by the diocese's Task Force On Changing Patterns of Sexuality and Family Life. In addition to calling for recognition for homosexual unions, it urges church support for premarital couples and what it calls ''postmarital'' couples, those who after divorce or death of a spouse decide to live with someone while remaining unmarried.",9360858
